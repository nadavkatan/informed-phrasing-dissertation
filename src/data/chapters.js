        content: `<i>Informed Phrasing</i>, a somewhat ambiguous title for a research project, as it was criticized for more than once. In its ambiguity it reflects some of the greatest challenges entailed in conducting artistic research: realizing what is it really about; what is it exactly that I am researching; and what drives me to do it so relentlessly. In the last years, as I was immersed in my project, I was operating primarily on gut feelings. Terrains of knowledge and experimentation appeared to be relevant for no clear reason but that something within me compelled me towards them. It is only now, in the very moments of writing the last chapter of my dissertation: the introduction, that I truly understand this project and what it means to me. `,

        content: `The last word of the title, <i>phrasing</i>, is no more than a practical delineation of scope. It means that the subject under investigation, whatever it is, is applied to <i>phrasing</i> as a specific and central component of musical performance. The ambiguity of the title, however, is due to the absence of its first word, the adverb that precedes the adjective ‘informed’. This grammatical component would have elucidated the specific agent involved in the process of informing one’s use of phrasing. Considering my decision to incorporate Schenkerian and cognitive-grouping analyses into the project, perhaps a coherent (yet wrong) wording would have been <i>‘Analytically Informed Phrasing’</i> or <i>‘Schenkerian Phrasing’</i>. But what I have come to realize regarding music analysis is that it sheds a stronger light on the person conducting the analysis rather than on the composition under inspection. Accordingly, both my attention and intention in using analytical methods shifted from observing compositional processes embedded in scores, towards the creative processes essential to musical performance. The particular ‘informing agents’ involved in this project, i.e., Schenkerian analysis and Cognitive psychology, were not applied in order to justify interpretative choices or prescribe performance grounded on objectivity, but rather to stimulate critical-artistic reflection; to cultivate a genuine interaction between musician and music; to generate questions and grapple with them; to facilitate creativity and reinforce individuality. This, as any practice of informed performance should promote, regardless of the agents involved. `,

It is, in fact, not at all concerned with the development of creative abilities. The expectations placed upon performance students do not revolve around demonstrating artistic creativity or independent thought. Instead, the emphasis lies on being exceptionally talented in doing what they are told, and in cultivating a high level of skill to effectively realize the interpretations of their masters as if they were their own. `,

Thereafter, the professor offers a general assessment, highlighting notable tendencies in the student's performance and classifying them as either favorable or unfavorable, based on the degree to which these tendencies align with the professor’s view of the composition and the prevailing norms of musical interpretation. Finally, the professor, using a plethora of methodologies, thoroughly imposes their own educated interpretation on the student's performance. When the student manages to react swiftly, the professor is happy. Over time, the student's artistic independence takes shape as they acquire the skill to predict the professor's feedback and apply it before it is offered. `,

Furthermore, the music created by these composers exists in the form of ‘works’ – put down into musical scores. Each work has inherent characteristics that form its <i>true</i> identity, which must resonate in any performance. The identity of a composition – its <i>truth</i>, is concealed within the musical score, and performance students must trust their teachers for knowing this truth. By faithfully and meticulously following the teacher’s instructions, the performance student will have the chance to sonically reproduce the work as <i>truly</i> intended by the composer. In doing so, the performer fulfills their role in society, that is, as Leech Wilkinson puts it: to do ‘history in sound’.`,

It is the same comfort that religious orthodox practitioners possess – the comfort of <i>Teshuva</i>.

It tackles various aspects involved in forming an artistic performance such as dealing with cryptic and ambiguous music scores, making interpretative choices, and grappling with the technical and cognitive challenges involved in musical performance. This was done using activities that, to my contention, are crucial for creativity: analyzing, critically questioning, experimenting, negotiating, and reflecting. Ultimately, this research project aimed at composing a working methodology called the <i>Performative Deep Structural Analysis</i>, which focuses on individual artistry in the performance of pre-written, mostly tonal, compositions. This project also holds a pedagogical focus. My aim was to encourage artistic thinking in students of musical performance, providing them with specific tools developed within this project to support and enhance their creative approach to the interpretation of tonal music. The interaction with the students was not merely a form of output for this project but had a methodological significance in developing and testing the PDSA.`,

        content: `<i>Phrasing</i>, has been justifiably described as ‘the most abused term in the entire musical lexicon’<span class="footnote">1</span>, ‘…so meaningless has it become’<span class="footnote">2</span>. Indeed, as it naturally is, the more often a certain word is spoken, the less people ponder about its meaning. One meaning of phrasing could pertain to compositional practice, as to how composers divide the musical continuum into phrases. However, composers avoided marking phrases on their scores, an avoidance that was perceived by 19th-century editors as a lack of proper methodology, leading to performances that “…fall very far short in representing the true meaning of music”<span class="footnote">3</span>. The editors, in their claim of understanding the true meaning of music in spite of the composers’ incompetence in regards to phrase markings, allowed themselves to use the legato slur in order to elucidate phrase boundaries on the score, thereby introducing the controversial ‘phrasing-slur’. There are several problems with the ‘phrasing-slur’; For one, it obscures the notion of what a ‘phrase’ is, which leads to definitions such as: “a group of notes that lies under a slur”<span class="footnote">4</span>. Furthermore, it implies that ‘phrasing’ means the articulation of these phrases, leading to the most acute misunderstanding around phrasing: the notion of phrasing simply as playing legato. In my view, phrasing entails two fundamental, somewhat intertwined components: <i>grouping</i> and <i>shaping</i>. `,

      {
        type: " text",
        content: `The <i>grouping</i> component of phrasing is essential for musical performance as tones don’t inherently belong to one group or another. A Group of tones (e.g., a musical phrase) is a perception that emerges when the relationship between the tones complies with a number of conditions recognized and formulated by Gestalt psychology<span class="footnote">5</span>. These conditions pertain to the spatial and temporal configurations of the tones as well as their properties. For instance, when the tones are relatively close to each other in pitch and time, and are similar to each other in timbre, the human mind tends to associate them with the same group. In the performance of existing, written music (which is the focus of this project), when a phrase is being performed, the sonic relationship between the tones of the phrase, and thereby, the cognitive formation of the phrase as a group, results from the collaboration between the composer and the performer. The musical score, provided by the composer, offers a number of groupings that may potentially emerge upon performance. From these affordances, the performer chooses the most artistically appropriate grouping structure to be communicated in performance. The performer, not necessarily being aware, would reinforce the Gestalt conditions that will allow his/her desired grouping structure to be perceived by the listener. Now, the performer might indeed use legato articulation in order to reinforce his/her grouping interpretation, yet not exclusively. Grouping tones into phrases can be achieved by using dynamics, timings, timbres, pedals, articulations, and the combinations of these. It is up to the performer to first reveal the potentialities embedded in the score, to experiment and realize their individual expressive consequences, and to find the appropriate means to realize these in performance. `,
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        content: `When a music teacher instructs a student to apply a certain <i>shaping</i> to a phrase, the teacher would use a physical gesture in conveying his/her wishes, so as to resemble the musical gesture to be achieved through the shaping of the phrase. In my years as a piano student, I have found using a physical representation to convey an intended musical gesture is extremely successful. The practice of music conducting is strong evidence for that, and the field of embodied music cognition provides interesting reasoning for that success, which is discussed in Chapter 7. The shaping component of phrasing can thus be understood as the musical parallel of an expressive physical gesture. It pertains to the performer’s continuous manipulation of time, volume, articulation, and timbre with the aim of inducing music with a sense of motion. A musical gesture is thus the complete trajectory of a musical unit created in performance. The most common schema used by (especially modern) performers for forming musical gestures is called the ‘phrase arch’. Performers continuously vary tempo and loudness across phrases so as to delineate their beginnings and ends. For example, a phrase’s beginning, articulated through a combination of accelerando and crescendo will build up toward a point of culminating tension that will be resolved by a complementing ritardando and diminuendo, marking the phrase’s end<span class="footnote">6</span>. This entire process coheres the individual tones of the phrase into a single Gestalt: an expressive musical gesture. This ‘phrase arch’ schema can be manifested in many different ways following the performer’s individual interpretation. Nevertheless, it has a rather direct relationship to the structure of musical pieces. It is a performative mean to project one’s analytical interpretation of the formal structure of a musical piece. It follows the notion that expressive performance is one that projects the structure of the piece. That being expressive means expressing the structure<span class="footnote">7</span>. It has indeed been observed that the degree to which phrase beginnings and ends are articulated in performances is often a function of the structural importance of a phrase<span class="footnote">8</span>. This direct association of an expressive mean of musical performance (e.g., shaping) to music analysis is a stylistic feature of modern performances<span class="footnote">9</span>. Musical masterpieces are elevated to the degree of the Bible (and composers to gods, see figure 1), and understanding and complying with composers’ intentions, as well as with what we imagine today as ‘stylistically authentic’, is what performers accept to be their duty. Analysis, then, is a tool to be used by performers in order to internalize the composer’s intentions, and the ‘phrase-arch’ is, in turn, used to sonically realize these intentions in performance. The aim of Informed phrasing was then to form a process in which performance can respond to analysis (and vice versa!) in a much less direct and artificial way. `,

Includes both the joining of notes into phrases and the separation of these phrases from each other”. The only reservation I have from this definition is that it seems to apply to ‘phrases’ exclusively. The term <i>Phrasing</i> itself is evidently not the most successful in symbolizing what it actually should represent, because put as such, it is inevitably linked to the term phrase. In tonal music, a <i>phrase</i> is a specific array of syntactical structures to which phrasing could apply in performance. However, phrasing applies not only to phrases, but as well to smaller units, or even segments of other functions (e.g., sequences, modulatory transitions, etc.). The appoggiatura, for example, is a unit that is significantly smaller than the phrase, to which phrasing can and should apply. The grouping level of the phrase simply represents the highest grouping level to which phrasing can apply.`,

Several levels exist simultaneously in linguistics: the syllables, which group into words – which group into phrases – which group into paragraphs etc.  The same grouping hierarchy exists in tonal music as well: individual sounds are grouped into motives – which are grouped into phrases – which are grouped into sections – which are grouped into movements etc. The difference here, which seems to me to contribute to the ambiguity around phrasing, is that while in linguistics, on the phrases’ level there are only phrases, in music, the grouping level of phrases can and normally does contain other syntactical structures than the musical phrase. Thus, while ‘phrasing’ in linguistics necessarily applies to phrases, musical phrasing applies to the generation and manipulation of musical gestures whose highest magnitude is the musical phrase. ",

When we perform a musical passage, we do not execute each and every note by itself. A musical fragment that contains 40 tones will not be performed through 40 isolated actions. The efficiency of piano performance at a very basic level groups notes into hand positions, thereby reducing the number of actions needed for the performance of the series of tones.

All these criteria have to do with the spatial configuration of stimulatory elements. The recognition that physical mechanisms influence perceived grouping structure led me to the formulation of the ‘motorically-imposed perceptual groupings’ which extend the existing Gestalt principles to account for the performer’s perspective.

Since then, profound controversy has surrounded this discipline. To an extent, it has to do with how analysis, performance, and even music itself are perceived and defined. The prevailing approach in the field, even today, views music as a sort of medium that does not necessarily require actual sounds in order to encapsulate meaning. Meaning can be packed into musical scores, and as widely regarded nowadays, musical scores are a form of encryption of composers’ musical ideas. Viewed as such, analysis is a systematic intellectual tool used in order to decrypt these musical ideas and lead toward an ideal realization of musical scores. Performance, in turn, <i>must follow</i> the ‘analytically-derived-performance-instructions’  to provide a truthful and authentic sonic embodiment of the composer’s intentions. It is no surprise that such a one-directional, functional relationship is easily resistible from an artistic point of view, as it does not account for the most important aspects of performance nor does it reinforce the most important characteristics of the performer: charisma, intuition, spontaneity, and inspiration. It is, after all, a sub-discipline of <strong>music theory</strong>, not of music performance. In a way, in the Informed Phrasing research project, I try to approach the analysis-practice relationship as if it were a sub-discipline of musical performance. `,

As Schenker stated in the opening of his <i>Vom Vortrag</i>: “… a composition does not require a performance in order to exist”<span class="footnote">3</span>. The scholars who established this approach are Heinrich Schenker, Arnold  Schoenberg, Wallace Berry, and Eugene Narmour. Analysis, then, is an intellectual procedure exercised on the score to reveal the formal relationships embedded in it. The analytical interpretations are then translated into performance instructions. Music analysis is regarded as the foundation of a performance, as a way of grounding or even validating the performance objectively. A good performance is thus perceived as realizing the true content of the composition, as was intended by the composer. Within this perception, a performance can be entirely deducted from the score through analysis. Narmour went as far as using analysis in assessing and criticizing performances, claiming that:  "…if formal relations are not properly analyzed by the performer, as well as carefully delineated in the performance itself, then many negative consequences follow”<span class="footnote">4</span>. `,

Schenker instructs to utilize any means available to the performer, such as the use of dynamics, articulation, fingerings, hand motion, pedal, hand pedal etc., to ultimately make the structural interpretation audible. Nevertheless, it should be noted that Schenker did expect the performer to do so with a certain level of sophistication and subtlety.

Every practicing musician knows that some concert halls are so acoustically dry, that playing <i>piano</i> is not even an option, and to create an effect of <i>p,</i> the performer must essentially play <i>mezzo forte</i> or even <i>forte</i>. Thus, Schenker interprets performance instructions as desired effects, rather than performance prescriptions to be literally realized. This notion of a performance instruction as an <i>effect</i>, rather than a mean, is one aspect that enables individuality and subjectivity in musical performance.

An example from the field of vision cognition would be the ‘Gestalt principle of closure’: when tempted to, the human mind perceives lines that do not exist in order to form closed figures<span class="footnote">13</span>. Therefore, perceiving coherence does not necessarily mean hearing coherence, as much as perceiving a triangle would not necessarily mean seeing three complete verticals. In other words, if the fundamental line is responsible for creating 'a sense of coherence', it does not necessarily mean that 'allowing the fundamental line to be heard' is the most artistically appropriate manner to create 'a sense of coherence' in each and every musical example if at all necessary.`,

When I tried to exercise this process in my practice, it simply felt awkward and superficial. John Rink, in his review of Wallace Berry’s <i>Musical Structure and Performance</i> puts it perfectly: “Attempting to recast the findings of analysis into a performance mould seems to me not unlike translating a book into another language word-for-word without regard to the second language’s particular idioms, grammar and syntax…Capturing the meaning or ‘spirit’ of the original – surely the most important goal of any translation – would be virtually impossible in such an undertaking”<span class="footnote">14</span>. Accordingly, in <i>Informed Phrasing</i>, I searched for ways that would be more artistically appropriate to both form and respond to fundamental lines so that indeed a sense of coherence could emerge in performance, yet this would be complemented by equally important effects such as a sense of immediacy, spontaneity, and sincerity. `,

Analysis is used as a mode of performance or as composing, rather than as a tool to unveil objective truths about music. An analytical interpretation would then <i>construct</i> rather than <i>construe</i> meaning out the score: “…the analyst tends to create the very meanings he or she presumes to uncover”<span class="footnote">15</span>. Cook furthermore claims that Schenker has essentially had the same perception of music analysis as a mere suggestion to hear music in a certain way. Analysis should not reflect how people listen to music but offer a certain hearing. The problem with Schenker is his imperative tone according to which there is only one correct and true way to hear music: the one supposedly intended by the composer. In response, Cook claims: “…we need a rationale for adopting Schenker’s analytical methods while rejecting his epistemology”<span class="footnote">16</span>. Cook rationalizes, then, that the musical score, on which analysis is conducted is inherently incomplete and thus bears various structural affordances; various potential hearings of the score. Viewed as such, analysis is a performative act: it is a process of exposing and grappling with ambiguities and bringing forth a way in which a certain musical composition might be heard. Understood as such, performers can then be granted the same degree of performativity as analysis. `,

          `<strong>Exposing ambiguities to be grappled with in performance:</strong> <br/> Swinkin claims that ambiguity is an essential artistic quality as it precludes facile engagement with the artwork. Idiosyncratic interpretation thrives on ambiguity because it solicits our involvement and begs us to construct meaning. In music, ambiguity is often manifested in structural uncertainty, and it is the performer’s fundamental task to explore it and project a single definitive way to hear the piece out of the multiple inherent expressive possibilities embedded in the score.`,
          `<strong>Metaphors for emotive and physical states:</strong> <br/> Unambiguous analytical statements can be viewed as metaphors for physical and emotive states and thus become available to be sonically embodied in performance. Referring to Schenkerian analysis, Swinkin suggests that expressive potentialities emerge when one turns their attention to the relationships between surface and background structure. Thus, instead of focusing on the ways in which the background structure can be made audible in performance with the aim of ‘revealing the truth’ about the composition, Swinkin suggests that the comprehension of the background structure illuminates the particularities of the foreground. This interaction between foreground and background, according to Swinkin, “holds salient physical implications”<span class="footnote">17</span> that can certainly be regarded in performance. For example, a common Schenkerian phenomenon in which background structure is manifested in the foreground is the ‘motivic parallelism’ (i.e., a motive that originates in the deep structure finds expression in the lower structural levels: the foreground and the surface). The particular way in which the motive is manifested in the foreground, for instance, stretched or compressed, can have expressive potentialities to be embodied in performance. It can be correlated with tension and urgency in the case of compression, and thus with slight acceleration; or breadth, in the case of stretched motive, which would might mean stretching the tempo. Another ‘structural metaphor’ for emotive experience recognized by Swinkin is linear motions from an inner voice as gradually emerging from beneath the surface. This could be manifested with a gradual crawling crescendo. The arrival at the structural note as emerging from beneath the surface into the light of day which would have timbral consequences in performance. `,

        content: `John Rink suggests that the confusion and controversy around the application of music analysis to performance is a result of the discrepancy between what performers conceive of music analysis and the analyses that are normally exercised and published in musicological scholarship. Musical performance requires a thorough process of decision-making and indeed most performers are concerned with how music ‘works’ and how to overcome conceptual challenges. This process, in many cases, involves an analytical investigation. Nevertheless, the kind of investigation employed by performers as they construct their interpretation is of a different nature than the musicological, formal music analysis that has so far been forced onto performance. The two sorts of analysis differ in various aspects such as the methodological rigor, the system, the completeness, the terminology applied, and the areas of interest. Rink labels the analysis that is most relevant for performers <i>a performer’s analysis</i> and conceives it as the “considered study of the score with particular attention to contextual functions and [the] means of projecting them” (Rink, 1990, 323). This is not an independent procedure applied to the act of interpretation but is an integral part of it.  As opposed to the ‘musicological analysis’ which explores the structure of music, the <i>performer’s analysis</i>, according to Rink, is primarily concerned with the shape of music, and is often guided by what Rink calls <i>Informed Intuition:</i> performance intuition based upon considerable knowledge and experience.`,

It can be used both prior to practice, as a way of establishing an initial interpretation, or as dealing with interpretative problems that emerge in the practicing process; “…when intuition failed to crack an intractable problem”. The performer’s analysis is a compilation of several analytical undertakings that Rink suggests: identifying formal structural divisions and basic tonal plan, graphing tempo, graphing dynamics, graphing melodic shape and contour, and preparing a rhythmic reduction. The insights generated by these analyses accumulate into ‘intensity curves’, i.e., “a graphic representation of the music’s ebb and flow, its ‘contour’ in time”<span class="footnote">18</span>.  Going through Rink’s demonstrations of how he exercises these analyses, I was struck to see how accessible and highly relevant these are for performers. For example, an issue that I often grapple with in the preparation of a musical performance is the large-scale dynamic shape of the composition. In which part of the composition should the climax be created? How and where should the music build up towards it, and resolve after it? Are there multiple climaxes and how do they compare in significance? The dynamics graphing suggested By Rink would be a good way to start solving these problems. Rink offers to create a temporal graph that maps the dynamic marks in the score onto the relevant bars in which they occur (see Figure 2).`,

As I explored the ways I can interact with these components in my practice, I realized that as relevant for my practice as they can be, the criteria upon which my analytical interpretation is formed are too intellectually oriented to be incorporated into my performance. I found that in Schenkerian analysis, for instance, the top-down approach in which the process of classifying tones as structural, which primarily relies on the potential compatibility with predefined contrapuntal formulas, contradicts how I <i>experience</i> the music. Furthermore, it often happened that groupings that should emerge in perception (based on Gestalt principles) were barely possible to be <i>experienced</i> in the act of performance. I concluded that to the end of enhancing my performance, analytical decisions should be made based on performative experiences rather than on predefined concepts. Accordingly, for analysis to represent performative experience, the act of performance must be a part of the analytical procedure. In the context of my personal practice, <i>Analysis</i> should not be a segregated mental exercise applied to (and thus constraining) performance, but rather an ongoing interaction between an ambiguous score, and the performer’s embodied cognition, leading to a fluid perception of the music that allows spontaneity, reinforces coherence, and most importantly: forms a deep connection the performer and their performance. `,

He is considered one of the most important figures in the field of music theory of the 20th century. Schenker developed a unique approach to music analysis, known as Schenkerian analysis, which emphasizes the underlying, generative structural relationships within a piece of music. He believed that the most important aspect of music was the tonal structure and that this structure could be revealed through analysis of the relationships between individual notes and chords.`,

Schenker's ideas have had a significant impact on the field of music theory, and his approach to analysis is still widely used and taught today.

        content: `The central component of Schenkerian analysis is the "Ursatz", also known as "the fundamental structure," which is a reduction of the music to its most basic harmonic and melodic components. The Ursatz is composed of a bass line, which serves as the foundation of the piece, and a series of harmonies and melodies that are built on top of this bass line. The extent to which a musical composition can be analyzed using the Schenkerian perspective is closely related to its level of tonality. Tonality, in my contention, is not a binary property of a composition, but rather a spectrum. The more tonal a composition is, the more suitable for Schenkerian analysis. For the Ursatz, the most fundamental component of Schenkerian analysis, is closely tied to Schenker's particular perception of tonality. Schenker viewed tonality as the life of a single tone as it governs the entire musical work. He explains how in nature, a single tone is built out of a fundamental and its various upper partials and harmonics. The first four harmonics produced out of the fundamental tone are the octave, the fifth, the following octave, and the major third. These harmonics form the major triad which Schenker called the 'Klang' (translated to 'Sound' or 'Ring').`,

The C2 is prolonged using several techniques: in bar 1 and 2, surface-level consonant skips and repetitions, then in bar 3, C2 changes its function and becomes a dissonant, passing note, between the locally prolonged Db2 and its consonant skip Bb. The Db2 functions as a high-level neighbor note of the C2 of the first two bars, which ultimately resolves back to C2 in the 4th bar. The reduction of this fragment presents my interpretation of the deep structure: the first two bars contain nothing but a prolonged C2, bar 3 accommodates Db2 as a neighbor note (which in Schenkerian graphing is marked as an eighth note), which is prolonged through the passing motion and resolves in bar 4. `,

This initial ascent is elaborated through another prolongation technique called ‘voice exchange’ in which the upper and lower voices exchange their tones: the very first C2 is being picked up by the bass in the 2nd beat of the same bar, and vice versa: the very first Ab of the bass is being picked up by the upper voice in the 2nd beat. The initial ascent in the upper voice is supported by a parallel progression in the bass, forming a linear intervallic pattern of parallel 10ths. A linear intervallic pattern is a contrapuntal pattern embedded in the surface. Parallel 10ths in particularly common pattern, yet others include patterns of 5 – 6, 8 – 10 , 5 – 8, 7 – 10, and many more. `,

Musical motion thus becomes structural, and structure, through motion, becomes expressive: “In the art of music, as in life, motion toward the goal encounters obstacles, reverses, disappointments, and involves great distances, detours, expansions, interpolations, and, in short, retardations of all kinds.

Within this context, I had the unique opportunity to interview Murray Perahia, a renowned Schenkerian performer. During our conversation, I inquired about Perahia’s vision regarding the relationship between Schenkerian analysis and musical expression in performance. Perahia claimed that expression stems from musical movement, and it is essential to uncover the construction and development of tonal motion in order to produce expressive performances. Perahia further observed that many student performers mistakenly attempt to be expressive with every single note, which ironically generates the opposite effect. Instead, performers should identify crucial expressive moments, represented by structural notes, and shape the musical motion in accordance with these notes. Phrasing gesture are thus created by using surface notes to direct motion towards structural notes as ‘phrasing – goals’. `,

The attainment, inhibition, or failure to achieve an anticipated resolution provokes a corresponding emotional response from the listener. Viewed from this perspective, the application of Schenkerian analysis can be highly illuminating in clarifying the processes that, following Meyer, generate emotions, which the performer can employ in order to produce expressive performances. `,

        content: `In his book, <i>The Expressive Movement</i>, Marc Leman, a cognitive scientist, explains how integral the motion of the human body is for expressive musical communication. He posits this model as a response to the conventional Shannon-Wiener communication model, which is primarily concerned with the transmission of semantic messages between a sender and a receiver.  According to the Shannon-Wiener communication model, successful communication occurs when the message conveyed by a sender (e.g., a musical performer), is interpreted by the receiver (e.g., a listener) in the way the sender intended it to be. This process begins with the sender being in an ‘intentional state’, encoding an intended message into a (musical) sound pattern. This pattern is transmitted to the receiver which decodes the pattern back to the message. For example, a successful communication will occur if a musical performer intends to convey the message ‘joy’, he successfully encodes this message into a sound pattern, and the listener that hears this pattern manages to decode that sound pattern into the message ‘joy’. However, the communication will be classified as ‘unsuccessful’ if the listener decodes the message ‘joy’ into ‘melancholy’.`,
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        content: `The most fundamental problem of this model, which Leman points out, is that it is based on a linguistic conception of music that focuses on <i>descriptions</i> of musical experiences (i.e., ‘joy’ and ‘melancholy’), rather than on the <i>experiences themselves</i> which can be much more difficult to capture and explicate. Decoding a musical pattern into a semantic meaning requires reflective conceptualization, which, in turn, required an external perspective on the experience. Thus, at the point in which the listener begins to consciously label the musical interaction, the communication effectively ends. In order to overcome these shortcomings, Leman offers his ‘pragmatic’ approach to musical communication that addresses the mechanisms through which experiences are formed, exchanged, and are associated with sound patterns. He resists the search for linguistic meanings by claiming that expressive interaction with music is meaningful in itself: “Music has the power to establish a stable regime of interdependent states (predictive, energetic, affective states) that offer a general condition of being (homeostasis) that is exceptionally rewarding and therefore empowering for the person involved”<span class="footnote">9</span>. Thus, meaning, according to Leman, is not semantic but experiential and embedded in the experience of ongoing interaction with music. This interaction occurs through <i>Enactment</i>: a process of reducing complex patterns into units that can be dealt with in terms of physical actions. <i>Enactment</i> includes the alignment of physical actions with sound patterns in order to both generate music (the performer’s perspective) and decode music (the listener’s perspective). This alignment of physical actions with sound patterns turns the complex patterns into units and projects the actions’ goals onto the musical patterns. This assignment of action-goal to musical-goal associates the musical patterns with intentions. The process of communication, thus, begins with the performer being in an intentional state, performing a physical action that encodes their intention into a sound pattern. Then, the listener aligns their physical movement to the sound pattern. The goal of the aligned movement is assigned to the sound pattern, which projects experiential meaning onto it. This does not end here; the perspective of the performer is not only that of the ‘sender’ which encodes physical actions into sound patterns, but that of the ‘receiver’, which physical movement in encoding the sound pattern is also used in decoding the sound pattern back to their artistic intention. The performer is thereby considered as a ‘sender-receiver’ in expressive musical communication. However, since the performer’s actions are conditioned by the physicality of the human body and its limitations (e.g., two hands with five fingers per hand, in a specific size that can grasp a limited range), incompatibilities between the encoding and decoding of sound patterns through performance actions, or, in other words, conflicts between artistic intention and motorically-imposed-cognition may occur. This phenomenon as well as how performers confront it is discussed in chapter 7, ‘The Motorically Imposed Perceptual Groupings’.`,

The three selected terrains (or as de Assis calls them: <i>things</i>): Schenkerian analysis, Gestalt psychology, and musical performance enter the <i>‘field of problematicity’</i>, where they are rearranged, and enter interaction as part of the creative process of artistic research. This interaction between the things reveals the weaknesses of each <i>thing</i> as well as stimulates the rearrangement, and perhaps evolution, in order to overcome these shortcomings. For example, as I applied the Gestalt grouping principles to my piano performance, the gap between theory and experience, as well as the false distinction between body and mind became very clear. This stimulated reflections, readings, discussions, and experimentations, which ultimately resulted in a set of principles that address these shortcomings and are presented in Chapter 7.`,

        items: [
          `Schenkerian analysis is typically conducted outside of performance setting which makes its application to performance awkward. This awkwardness, just like in Gestalt psychology, results from the gap between analytical statements that are generated purely based on compliance with a theory, and actual performance experience. A potential solution would be to conduct the analysis at the instrument, as part of the instrumental practice; as if to “consult” and thus involve performative experience in the analytical process. For me, that meant that the final analytical result does not need to be represented graphically, but sonically. This, however, necessitate the redesigning of the analytical process as well as the criteria upon which analytical judgments are made.`,
          `In Schenkerian analysis, analytical decisions are made based upon the potential compliance with predefined analytical dogmas. The techniques of contrapuntal prolongation described above can be applied to generate various analytical statements. Yet, the prevailing statement would necessarily be the one which manifests best the <i>Ursatz</i> and the <i>Motive</i><span class="footnote">10</span>. This compliance with these concepts is ultimately what makes an interpretation ‘Schenkerian’. In my experience, this very often results in theoretically proper, yet counter-intuitive interpretations that do not reflect musical experience. The solution that I offer to this problem, which I incorporated into my research, is to differentiate between <i>tools</i> and <i>theory</i>. <i>Tools</i>, being the contrapuntal prolongation techniques, and <i>theory</i> being the Schenkerian predefined dogmas. Then, using the <i>tools</i> to generate deep structural (non-Schenkerian) interpretations that are based on, and reflect performative experience rather than the <i>Ursatz</i>. This means that once deeply acquainted with contrapuntal techniques, performers can apply them to a musical fragment at the instrument, revealing all structural possibilities and impossibilities, and choosing the one that corresponds most closely with their experience. The deep, predefined contrapuntal formulas; the dogmas; are interesting to be acquainted with, but, for me, have no benefit applied to the performance act of phrasing and its performative-analytical preparation.`,

The emerging groups are the first fundamental step the human mind takes in ‘making sense’ of the stimuli it receives from the environment. Although the grouping principles were initially developed in order to explicate humans’ visual perception, they apply in a similar way to auditory perception as well.

To address this, the chapter will explore the ”motorically imposed perceptual grouping principles”, which take into account the performer's physical movements and actions as they relate to and determine the perception of sound. A list of these motorically imposed grouping principles will be presented, along with a discussion of the conflicts that can arise between artistic intentions and motorically imposed perceptions as cognitive dissonances.

The PDSA begins by exposing the structural affordances embedded in a musical score. Providing the ambiguity of the score, this includes examining which grouping structures can potentially emerge in performance. As I was working on a fragment of J.S. Bach’s Toccata from the 6th Partita, I noticed that despite having several theoretically plausible groupings embedded in the score, one particular grouping structure seemed to persistently prevail in my experience. This grouping structure, although compatible with the classical Gestalt principles, would not necessarily be the most theoretically probable one. Curiously, I noticed that this “improbable” grouping structure coincided perfectly with the division of the tones between my hands. This seemed to me to be more than a coincidence, and I immediately hypothesized that my experienced grouping structure, at least in this instance, is determined by the way I use my body in generating the sounds, rather than by the spatial configurations of the sounds, as the Gestalt psychology suggests. An initial test for this hypothesis is a very straightforward one: I played the musical fragment with a different hand division, and my hypothesis was confirmed: my grouping perception followed my hand division. In fact, my experienced grouping perception coincided entirely with any hand division I applied. Furthermore, I realized that intentionally perceiving a grouping structure that does not coincide with the hand position I use required a lot of mental effort. This made it reasonable for me to assume that my auditory perception is determined by the manner in which I use my body in generating the sounds I perceive. Moreover, I recognized that the Gestalt grouping principles, as well as Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s extension of it, are limited to only consider the listener’s perspective in grouping perception and that the structures perceived by a human that generates the sounds (i.e., a musical performer) might be based on entirely different criteria. It was then clear to me that for Informed Phrasing, the classical Gestalt principles, although still relevant, are simply not enough, and that two uncharted territories need to be explored: `,

          "The classical perceptual grouping principles mentioned above are founded upon the assertion that human perception is an exclusively mental function. In the writings on Gestalt, there is no reference to the human body and how physical movements can influence one’s perceptual organization. Nevertheless, recent studies in the field of embodied music cognition point to a dynamic system in which music perception is shaped through bodily engagements with music. For instance, in The Expressive Movement, Marc Leman argues that upon listening to music, the human mind associates sound patterns with intentional properties through the alignment of the body to the sound patterns. Thus, a 'goal-oriented physical action' is aligned to a musical pattern to which the mind assigns the action's goal. This idea is called 'embodiment': the process of transforming sound patterns into patterns with intentional properties; goal-oriented patterns, that are mediated through the human body and its actions repertoire. Despite the similarities in the action repertoires that we share as humans, each individual has their own personal collection of actions established upon their personal experiences. Considering the pivotal role of actions repertoire in embodied music cognition, these differences suggest that audio stimuli may be perceived differently among different individuals, as each may have different actions mediating the intentional properties of the same audio stimuli. Interestingly, Leman stresses that embodiment occurs also in instances in which the free movement of the body is inhibited, such as in western classical music concert settings.",

The alignment of body movements with music allows researchers to study human perception through objective measurements of body movements, which strengthens their assertions empirically. Nevertheless, the manner in which different people align their body movements to music can also depend on the mode of their interaction with the music; meaning, whether they listen, perform, or compose; the actions repertoire that they possess; and their learned associations between sound-producing actions and the sonic results of these actions. For example, through years of intense practice and repetition, musical performers learn to associate sound-producing actions with their sonic outcomes. Maes & Leman have shown that this learned association is so strong that for performers that the mere sight of a sound-producing action will suffice for the activation of the brain area responsible for the auditory reception of its outcome<span class="footnote">5</span>. On the other hand, listeners who do not have any training in musical performance do not necessarily associate musical sounds with their originating action. Rather, for listeners, musical sounds are associated with gestural aspects of the sound configurations; with 'expressive gesturing'. In fact, Leman argues that musical patterns are made to correspond to expressive gesturing so that listeners will be able to make sense of the patterns by aligning these to the intended outcomes of the gestures.`,

          "For Informed Phrasing, the crucial point here is the perceptual divergence between a listener and a professional musical performer; each processes musical patterns according to their own physical engagement with music and to learned actions - sonic outcomes associations. While musical performers align sound-producing actions with musical patterns, listeners align expressive gesturing with sound configurations of musical patterns. Going back to Gestalt psychology, the latter perfectly complies with Gestalt grouping principles, as they deal exclusively with sound configurations and properties (the proximity and similarity of sounds). Whereas for musical performers, I suggest, the current classical grouping principles appeal much less, as their perception is influenced more significantly by their repertoire of sound-producing actions, rather than the expressive gesturing associated with spatial configurations of the sounds they perform.

The purpose of this chapter, then, is to propose criteria for grouping organizations in human-music interaction that occurs in musical performance. That is, to attend to what the research on Gestalt psychology has so far overlooked: the perceptual grouping organization of musical performers, and how their use of their body in producing sounds influences their perceptual organization of these sounds.

The perspective of the performer is a complex one as it functions both as the generator and the receiver of auditory stimuli. The performer generates sounds, the process of which entails performing sound-producing actions that, as argued above, influence the performer’s perception of the sounds. Nonetheless, performers also hear the sounds that they generate, which to a certain extent, put them in the perspective of the listeners, which, as argued above, is influenced by the spatial configurations of the received sounds. I often play around these two perspectives as I perform: in some performances I immerse myself into the performance as a physical activity, almost like dancing; and in other performances, I try to detach myself from my body and put myself entirely in the perspective of the listener as an attempt to grasp how my audience might experience my performance.

When there are multiple theoretically plausible perceptual structures, in many cases the perceiver would have the ability to consciously choose what to perceive.

These situations should be considered as opportunities for the performer to experiment and explore the various grouping structures afforded in a given musical situation and their artistic-musical consequences. Then, once a grouping interpretation has been established, the performer would might wish to realize this interpretation in their performance. But an interesting challenge occurs when such artistically established grouping interpretation contradicts a motorically imposed grouping perception. This situation, I propose, can be understood as cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is a state of discomfort generated by a discrepancy between conflicting cognitions. This state motivates the experiencing person to strive for a resolution, typically by adjusting one cognition to the other. Such cognitive dissonances are challenges that performers must confront in order to successfully convey their artistic intentions. Furthermore, the process of dealing with such cognitive dissonances is an integral part of the practice of musical performance.

When such cognitive dissonance is aroused, a process of ‘negotiation’ will emerge in which the performer would experiment with possible mediations in an effort of resolving the dissonance. Ideally, this could be achieved by aligning the physical mechanisms of performance to conform with artistic intentions. In other cases, the performer might even consider modifying the artistic intentions to conform to motoric constraints.

While in most cases, though not all, improvisation is the final art form presented to the audience, in <i>Informed Phrasing</i>, improvisation is a tool used primarily in generating artistic interpretations for written compositions. The term itself can have different meanings and is associated with different practices. However, in <i>Informed Phrasing</i>, ‘improvisation’ pertains more closely to terms such as ‘counterpoint improvisation’ and perhaps even ‘generative improvisation’. While the first two modes of interaction result in a contrapuntal analysis which contains several levels of structural abstraction, improvisation is a device the performer uses in order to make their way back from the deep structure generative the musical surface. Along this way, the performer ‘re-composes’ the music, traversing through the different structural levels. It is in the sense of using improvisation as a tool to generate musical surfaces through the prolongation of deep contrapuntal and harmonic structures that I use the label: ‘generative-improvisation’. In this process, performance decisions, such as phrasing gestures, are made spontaneously, yet are based on a rational analysis, grounded upon individual musical experience. Each session leads to different phrasing interpretations, which may or may not manifest the underlying analysis. The performers can then evaluate the emerging phrasings and select those that they wish to incorporate into their final performance of the musical surface.

In the research process of <i>Informed Phrasing</i>, I became aware of the various benefits of that creative interaction: the internalization of musical analysis, the balance achieved between rationality and immediacy, the creation and reinforcement of deep connections between the performers and their interpretations and the stimulation of the unique state-of-mind during improvisation: a state of mind that can be utilized not only during improvisation, but in the performance of written compositions as well.  `,

The methodology involves analyzing various levels of structural abstractions of the piece and experimenting with different ways of spontaneously ‘opening them up’ through improvisation. In the analysis, students seek long-term harmonic processes of ‘tension’- ‘relaxation’, which form ‘fundamental structures’ and serve as a basis for creative improvisation. The goals of this process are to enhance performers’ ability to apply structural and harmonic knowledge in real-time, develop a deeper understanding of stylistic nuances, and enable the exploration of multiple interpretations of a musical piece. Through this process, the performers’ creativity and freedom are reinforced, while maintaining a strong grasp of the underlying structure. `,

In this study, Dolan et. al compared two chamber music performances of the same pre-written musical composition, each of which was instructed to apply either a ‘standard approach’ (which includes re-production of the agreed-upon performance actions and interpretations), or an ‘improvisatory approach’ (which includes spontaneous decision making and insertions of extemporized notes). This comparison allowed the researchers to pinpoint and characterize a distinct state-of-mind relating to the improvisatory performances. This state of mind, as was established in their study, was not only shared between the members of the ensemble, but to an extent, with audience members as well. Additionally, it was found that improvisatory performances were more varied in performed timbres and dynamics, had longer-term phrasing gestures, and were perceived as more musically convincing and emotionally compelling by audience members. Most importantly, the data extracted and analyzed through <i>Sonic Visualizer</i>, as well as the performers' accounts revealed that compared to the standard performance, in the improvisatory one, the performers were more immersed in the act of performance in a manner that aligns with the state of Flow, as outlined by Csikszentmihalyi<span class="footnote">5</span>. As a performer, which improvisation was not an integrated part of his daily practice, the findings of this study resonated with my experience in my own research process. The fact that this state of mind is not limited to being invoked merely upon actual improvisations, but can be utilized for the performances of written music, made the choice to incorporate ‘generative-improvisation’ into the PDSA all the more intriguing.  `,

This collection, which Gjerdingen, in his book <i>Music in the Galant Style</i>, insightfully equates to the <i>Zibaldon</i> of the actors of the <i>Commedia dell’arte</i>, would then serve as a stock of possible realizations with which performers could form their improvisations. `,

However, since the Galant schemas belong primarily to the structural foreground – shallow middle ground, they seem very tangible and generally conform with how music actually feels. Whereas Schenker’s formulas (i.e., the few variations of the Ursatz), stretch over much larger time spans and thus make it virtually impossible to experience their link to surface realizations.

          `<strong><i>Analytical interaction:</i></strong><br/>The fundamental premise allowing this analytical interaction is that music scores are inherently ambiguous in the sense that they afford numerous analytical interpretations, i.e., <i>analytical affordances</i>. The mindset encouraged during this phase is driven by <i>questioning</i> rather than <i>seeking definitive answers</i>, ultimately aiming at exposing structural ambiguities.  The performers should approach the music score with an analytical orientation, but more importantly, with an open mind. They should ask themselves: "What could this music be?" rather than fixating on what the music objectively is, with the aim of uncovering as many analytical affordances and contradictions as possible. Moreover, it is strongly encouraged that the performers undertake this initial phase while engaging with their musical instrument. The intent is for their analytical approach to transcend the purely intellectual realm and involve the natural skill they inherently possess: the ability to play music.`,
          `<strong><i>Pragmatic interaction</i></strong><br/>The ‘pragmatic’ interaction is a phase of critical reflection through musical performance. It facilitates a negotiation between analytical statements generated through the ‘analytical interaction’ and embodied cognitive experience inherent in musical performance. Furthermore, it includes the negotiation between one’s artistic intentions and their embodied-cognitive perception of the music being performed. It is this interaction that initiated the exploration of principles of <i>Motorically Imposed Perceptual Groupings<span class="footnote">2</span></i><br/>The primary objective of this phase is to grapple with analytical ambiguities and refine the analytical statements formulated during the <i>analytical interactions</i> by confronting them with performer's own experiential context. The reflections process is aided by several guiding questions: which of the analytical statements <i>work</i> best in performance? which of them has a stronger artistic impact? how can I use my physical performative experience to refine analytical statements? Should I align the analysis with my performance actions and if so, how? Should I align my performance actions with the analysis and if so, how? How can I use my performative experience to resolve analytical ambiguities?.<br/><br/> This process ultimately guides the performer in selecting and patching analytical statement based on their artistic value and alignment with embodied-cognitive experience in performance, or, put simply, on how they <i>feel</i> in performance. I strongly believe that grounding the analysis on performative experience is the key to making analysis compatible for musical performance. At the end of this phase, the performer has a formulated analytical representation of the music which he can start to creatively interact with and respond to.`,
          `<strong><i>Creative interaction</strong></i><br/>One of the most challenging issues I had to confront in the course of my research process revolved around the practical application of analytical insights in the context of musical performance. In essence, once we've established an analytical representation of the music, how should performance respond to it, if at all?<br/><br/>In chapter 4 of this dissertation, titled, “The Relationship Between Music Analysis and Performance”, I delved into the prevailing approaches to this subject. These approaches generally entail an essentially intellectual process of decision-making, wherein analytical insights are translated into performance actions. However, these approaches do vary in the degree of "directness" of translations (for an in-depth review, please refer to Chapter 4). When I tried to exercise this translation process in my own practice, I found it to be somewhat awkward. Despite having analytical justifications, the performance decisions felt rather unnatural to me. I could not to sense that the resulting performance genuinely conveyed the emotions and artistic nuances I experience within the music.<br/> This led me to explore an approach that stands somewhat in contrast to the intellectually-driven process — a creativity-oriented approach rooted primarily in improvisation. This creative process is underpinned by several key principles:`,

          `The analytical representation that comes in interaction with performance needs to be compatible for such interaction.

This guideline is discussed in the context of the first two modes of interaction described above.`,
          `The analytical representation should not be merely rooted in performance experience but deeply embedded within it. `,
          `The response of the performance to the analytical representation of the music should flow intuitively, guided by artistic sensibility rather than conscious deliberation. `,

In short, while the first two phases of the PDSA intended to explore the structural depths of music, the “creative interaction” employs generative improvisation as a means to resurface from the depths. This process primarily uses the Schenkerian tool of <i>Auskomponierung</i>, or “composing-out”, in order to depart from deep contrapuntal progressions back towards the musical surface. `,

          `<strong>Forming a grouping structure</strong><br/><i>Analytical interaction – revealing structural affordances</i><br/>The process of creating a grouping structure begins with the exploration of structural affordances of a musical phrase. In essence, this entails recognizing the potential groupings within the score by drawing upon various principles of cognitive grouping formations, such as the Gestalt principles and those related to motorically imposed perceptual groupings. The performer's task is to unveil the numerous organizational possibilities inherent in the musical score.<br/><br/><i>Pragmatic interaction – negotiating</i><br/>Subsequently, the performer ‘interacts’ with the revealed grouping structures, as well as with their own embodied cognition in performance - through performance. This interaction aims to determine the most effective grouping structure in practice. The performer additionally attempts to enhance their perception of the selected grouping structure. This may entail adjusting the physical mechanisms involved in performance in order to align sound producing actions with artistically intended structures.`,
          `<strong>Forming the multileveled contrapuntal structure</strong><br/><i>Analytical interaction – revealing structural affordances</i><br/>Deriving a grouping structure from the score is inherently significant for practice of phrasing, as discussed in chapter 2, titled “The Art of Phrasing”. Nevertheless, the amalgamation of the two informing agents of Informed Phrasing, namely, grouping and shaping take form in a manner akin to Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s <i>Generative Theory of Tonal Music</i>. In this context, the grouping structure serves as a foundational element for contrapuntal reduction.<br/><br/>Starting from lower-level grouping structure, the performer reduces the sounds within each group to include just 1 to 2 notes. This process establishes the first lower-level contrapuntal reduction of the music. With this reduction, the performer proceeds to use the grouping structure at the next higher level to repeat this process, creating the contrapuntal reduction at the subsequent higher level. This sequence continues until the contrapuntal reduction attains a level of abstraction parallel to the phrase’s <i>Ursatz</i>. The result is a hierarchical, multileveled contrapuntal reduction of the music.<br/><br/>In this process it becomes clear that contrapuntal reduction is to a large extent depends on grouping structure. Thus, different grouping interpretations would generate different analytical affordances for the contrapuntal reduction.<br/><br/>It's important to note that at each stage of reduction, it is common to encounter multiple structural affordances, such as various potential contrapuntal progression. The performer is not required to ascertain a single “correct” analytical statement. Instead, as a preparatory step for the forthcoming interaction phrase, they should aim to unveil as many structural affordances as possible. In this context, a solid grasp of Schenkerian tools of contrapuntal prolongation (see chapter 5, “Schenkerian Analysis and Tonal Motion”) becomes crucial. <br/><br/><i>Pragmatic interaction – negotiating</i><br/>Once more, the performer engages with the analytical affordances through their performative experience. The performer actively experiments with the different reductions during practice, assessing them based on their resemblance of musical surface, their presumed emotional content, and their artistic impact on performance. The formulation of the final reduction need not be a result of rationalization but should intuitively resonate during practice. At the end of this phase, the performer should have a well-formulated analytical representation of the phrase. <br/><br/>The choice of the final reduction need not be a result of rationalization but should, instead, intuitively resonate during practice. By the conclusion of this phase, the performer should possess a finely crafted analytical representation of the phrase. `,
          `<strong>Generative improvisation</strong><br/><i>Creative interaction – a performative response to music analysis</i><br/>The “creative interaction” begins with an iterative rendition of the deepest contrapuntal reduction established in the analysis. Once the performer feels sufficiently prepared, they start embellishing the notes of this foundational reduction. The embellishments are meant to be entirely spontaneous and should progressively evolve in complexity, thereby guiding us to the next structural level of the analysis. The tools of Schenkerian prolongation, e.g., neighbouring notes, passing notes, appoggiaturas, etc., can assist the performer in their embellishments of structural notes. The same procedure should then unfold within the next structural level, thus carving the way to the subsequent one, ultimately completing the circle by coming back to the musical surface.<br/><br/>In essence, these evolving improvisational embellishments serve as a means to compose-out (Auskomponierung) the abstract contrapuntal progressions present in the analysis, effectively bringing forth the musical surface from its contrapuntal depths. This process ensures the transformation of the analysis from a mental representation of music into an experience seamlessly integrated into the act of performance. Furthermore, the final sonic outcome, namely the performance of the musical surface, does not arise from a deliberate decision-making process but rather as a spontaneous, performative response to the analysis. Finally, whether the analysis becomes audible or not is determined by the performance intuition of each individual performer. `,

Interestingly, although all the students majored in musical performance (classical piano), their approach to answering my questions was always intellectually rather than experientially oriented. They regularly turned to musical analysis or to the history of musical performance styles, seeking the 'correct', 'true' answer, instead of trusting their artistic expertise and intuition and exploring the grouping formations that they experience in performance, that are true for them. Some students were even consistently reluctant to 'consult' their performative experience in exploring groupings. This might have been a coincidence, but these were the more advanced students. Furthermore, it so happened that the students who were in the first years of their academic trajectory were much more open-minded, and the process of asking questions, revealing ambiguities, interacting with these ambiguities, and resolving ambiguities was much more natural to apply. `,

This revealed an extremely repetitive and consistent performance gesture in the pre-pdsa performance. This gesture, I believe, is what leads to an impression of 'formal', ‘objective’ performance.  The use of time fluctuations is extremely regular. In every bar, Alex consistently shortens the 3rd beats and prolongs the 1st beats. The 3rd beats are consistently shorter than the average beat length, and the 1st is consistently longer than the 3rd. This tendency occurs throughout the performance with one exception: the 6th bar, in which he prolongs the 3rd beat. This 3rd beat happens to accommodate the highest note of the phrase which is also marked with an accent in the score. Conclusively, Alex applies this gesture for accentuation throughout his performance, mostly in order to emphasize the meter, and exceptionally for emphasizing high notes. As opposed to that, the dynamics are not used to emphasize the first beat, at least not in a consistent manner. He does use dynamics, however, to accentuate the high note in bar 6. Besides that, there seems to be no consistent use of the dynamics. While the time fluctuations were used to project the metric structure, the dynamics project a grouping structure of 4 + 4 through softening phrase ends, thereby conforming with Todd's phrase-arch model. `,

As mentioned above, the post-pdsa performance presents a more extensive use of dynamic fluctuations as well as a larger dynamic span. These, together with the time fluctuations happen to project more saliently the grouping structure both in its largest form (4+4) and in more nuanced formations. Although this might imply a "structural performance", the impression is a rather more varied and communicative performance, and, in my personal opinion, coherent and genuine. `,

Personally, interacting with Pieter served as a valuable exercise in guiding students with critical minds who don't merely accept information as facts but encourage deeper exploration and the presentation of compelling arguments. In Pieter’s case, the primary challenge centered around his understanding of cognitive group subdivisions. He was deeply committed to expressing longer phrasing lines in the 1st theme of W.A. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 27. However, this commitment sometimes hindered his ability to recognize that longer musical phrases inherently consist of shorter, interconnected components. Understanding and acknowledging these shorter groups might be crucial in achieving an interpretation that could effectively support his desire for extended phrasing gestures. Furthermore, Pieter struggled with the systematic application of the PDSA. He exhibited a tendency to rush straight to the contrapuntal reduction, bypassing the essential step of forming a grouping structure. This inclination posed an additional layer of complexity in our collaborative work.`,

It is clear that while the pre-pdsa performance is rather static dynamically (which would contribute to smaller groupings being projected), the post-pdsa performance has a clear, Todd-style phrase-arch that encompasses the entire phrase, marking it as the most prominent structural group. This coincides beautifully with Pedro's experience with the PDSA method. For him, the method should be used to engrave his artistic conception of the phrase into his performative experience, enabling him to easily communicate his intentions with his audience: an extremely important and challenging aspect of musical performance.`,

The post-pdsa performance also had better phrase shaping.

The inquiry aimed to determine whether the Performative-Deep-Structural-Analysis (PDSA) method could resonate with and positively influence a range of performers. The results, as unveiled through the experiences of participating students, provided valuable glimpses into the potential of this performative-analytical approach within the realm of musical performance.`,

Importantly, it became evident that, for the students, this exploration served as an introductory "taste" of the methodological process. The course acted as a catalyst, sparking curiosity and opening the door for further exploration. It is now within the realm of each student's agency to delve deeper into the methodology, customize it according to their artistic inclinations, and discern its potential for significant impact on their individual performances.`,

During the practical phase, it became notable that this influence is manifested uniquely not only between performers but also within different performances of the same student. This observation underscores a crucial facet of the PDSA method—it does not prescribe a standardized template for performance. Instead, it serves as a tool capable of eliciting distinctive and personalized interpretations for each performer. This inherent flexibility suggests that the methodology has the potential to bring forth something truly unique for every individual who engages with it, thereby enriching the landscape of musical interpretation and performance.`,

          `The very first step that one takes in performance analysis with <i>Sonic Visualizer</i> is marking beats by tapping on a computer key along as the playback of the recording. The marked beats can then be adjusted to better depict the analyst’s experience. All of the quantitative data that will then be provided by <i>Sonic Visualizer</i> depends on this first step. Since beats marking inevitably vary between different analysts, the quantitative data and thereby, the resulting analysis can be expected to vary as well. A specific plugin that can automatically mark the beats of a performance would potentially solve this issue. Until then, however interesting the insights that <i>Sonic Visualizer</i> can provide on a performance, we should be mindful to not consider it a purely objective representation of the performance, but rather as a visual representation of the analyst’s experience of the performance.`,
