          "On a personal note, I always considered phrasing as the most important element of my musical performance. It is the one that brings the most frustration in practice, but also the highest joy on stage. No other element of musical performance offers such an opportunity to have direct musical communication. To speak, sing, shout and cry through the tip of the fingers.",

        content: `<i>Phrasing</i>, has been justifiably described as ‘the most abused term in the entire musical lexicon’<span class="footnote">1</span>, ‘…so meaningless has it become’<span class="footnote">2</span>. Indeed, as it naturally is, the more often a certain word is spoken, the less people ponder about its meaning. One meaning of phrasing could pertain to compositional practice, as to how composers divide the musical continuum into phrases. However, composers avoided marking phrases on their scores, an avoidance that was perceived by 19th-century editors as a lack of proper methodology, leading to performances that “…fall very far short in representing the true meaning of music”<span class="footnote">3</span>. The editors, in their claim of understanding the true meaning of music in spite of the composers’ incompetence in regards to phrase markings, allowed themselves to use the legato slur in order to elucidate phrase boundaries on the score, thereby introducing the controversial ‘phrasing-slur’. There are several problems with the ‘phrasing-slur’; For one, it obscures the notion of what a ‘phrase’ is, which leads to definitions such as: “a group of notes that lies under a slur”<span class="footnote">4</span>. Furthermore, it implies that ‘phrasing’ means the articulation of these phrases, leading to the most acute misunderstanding around phrasing: the notion of phrasing simply as playing legato. In my view, phrasing entails two fundamental, somewhat intertwined components: <i>grouping</i> and <i>shaping</i>. `,

        content: `The <i>grouping</i> component of phrasing is essential for musical performance as tones don’t inherently belong to one group or another. A Group of tones (e.g., a musical phrase) is a perception that emerges when the relationship between the tones complies with a number of conditions recognized and formulated by Gestalt psychology<span class="footnote">5</span>. These conditions pertain to the spatial and temporal configurations of the tones as well as their properties. For instance, when the tones are relatively close to each other in pitch and time, and are similar to each other in timbre, the human mind tends to associate them with the same group. In the performance of existing, written music (which is the focus of this project), when a phrase is being performed, the sonic relationship between the tones of the phrase, and thereby, the cognitive formation of the phrase as a group, results from the collaboration between the composer and the performer. The musical score, provided by the composer, offers a number of groupings that may potentially emerge upon performance. From these affordances, the performer chooses the most artistically appropriate grouping structure to be communicated in performance. The performer, not necessarily being aware, would reinforce the Gestalt conditions that will allow his/her desired grouping structure to be perceived by the listener. Now, the performer might indeed use legato articulation in order to reinforce his/her grouping interpretation, yet not exclusively. Grouping tones into phrases can be achieved by using dynamics, timings, timbres, pedals, articulations, and the combinations of these. It is up to the performer to first reveal the potentialities embedded in the score, to experiment and realize their individual expressive consequences, and to find the appropriate means to realize these in performance. `,

        content: `When a music teacher instructs a student to apply a certain <i>shaping</i> to a phrase, the teacher would use a physical gesture in conveying his/her wishes, so as to resemble the musical gesture to be achieved through the shaping of the phrase. In my years as a piano student, I have found using a physical representation to convey an intended musical gesture is extremely successful. The practice of music conducting is strong evidence for that, and the field of embodied music cognition provides interesting reasoning for that success, which is discussed in Chapter 7. The shaping component of phrasing can thus be understood as the musical parallel of an expressive physical gesture. It pertains to the performer’s continuous manipulation of time, volume, articulation, and timbre with the aim of inducing music with a sense of motion. A musical gesture is thus the complete trajectory of a musical unit created in performance. The most common schema used by (especially modern) performers for forming musical gestures is called the ‘phrase arch’. Performers continuously vary tempo and loudness across phrases so as to delineate their beginnings and ends. For example, a phrase’s beginning, articulated through a combination of accelerando and crescendo will build up toward a point of culminating tension that will be resolved by a complementing ritardando and diminuendo, marking the phrase’s end<span class="footnote">6</span>. This entire process coheres the individual tones of the phrase into a single Gestalt: an expressive musical gesture. This ‘phrase arch’ schema can be manifested in many different ways following the performer’s individual interpretation. Nevertheless, it has a rather direct relationship to the structure of musical pieces. It is a performative mean to project one’s analytical interpretation of the formal structure of a musical piece. It follows the notion that expressive performance is one that projects the structure of the piece. That being expressive means expressing the structure<span class="footnote">7</span>. It has indeed been observed that the degree to which phrase beginnings and ends are articulated in performances is often a function of the structural importance of a phrase<span class="footnote">8</span>. This direct association of an expressive mean of musical performance (e.g., shaping) to music analysis is a stylistic feature of modern performances<span class="footnote">9</span>. Musical masterpieces are elevated to the degree of the Bible (and composers to gods, see figure 1), and understanding and complying with composers’ intentions, as well as with what we imagine today as ‘stylistically authentic’, is what performers accept to be their duty. Analysis, then, is a tool to be used by performers in order to internalize the composer’s intentions, and the ‘phrase-arch’ is, in turn, used to sonically realize these intentions in performance. The aim of Informed phrasing was then to form a process in which performance can respond to analysis (and vice versa!) in a much less direct and artificial way. `,

        content: `With these two components in mind, I find William Rothstein’s definition of phrasing to be the closest reflection of my perception of phrasing: “The delineation and internal shaping of phrases by a musical performer. Includes both the joining of notes into phrases and the separation of these phrases from each other”. The only reservation I have from this definition is that it seems to apply to ‘phrases’ exclusively. The term <i>Phrasing</i> itself is evidently not the most successful in symbolizing what it actually should represent, because put as such, it is inevitably linked to the term phrase. In tonal music, a <i>phrase</i> is a specific array of syntactical structures to which phrasing could apply in performance. However, phrasing applies not only to phrases, but as well to smaller units, or even segments of other functions (e.g., sequences, modulatory transitions, etc.). The appoggiatura, for example, is a unit that is significantly smaller than the phrase, to which phrasing can and should apply. The grouping level of the phrase simply represents the highest grouping level to which phrasing can apply.`,

        content:
          " The terms ‘phrase’ and ‘phrasing’ originate in linguistics which is similar to tonal music for being hierarchical and generative. Several levels exist simultaneously in linguistics: the syllables, which group into words – which group into phrases – which group into paragraphs etc.  The same grouping hierarchy exists in tonal music as well: individual sounds are grouped into motives – which are grouped into phrases – which are grouped into sections – which are grouped into movements etc. The difference here, which seems to me to contribute to the ambiguity around phrasing, is that while in linguistics, on the phrases’ level there are only phrases, in music, the grouping level of phrases can and normally does contain other syntactical structures than the musical phrase. Thus, while ‘phrasing’ in linguistics necessarily applies to phrases, musical phrasing applies to the generation and manipulation of musical gestures whose highest magnitude is the musical phrase. ",

Instead of focusing on testing, experiments should be concentrated on what scientists actually <i>do</i>; the concrete and manual manipulation of objects, and the unexpected results that emerge in the process. Paulo de Assis, an artistic researcher at the Orpheus Institute, appropriated Rheinberger’s concept of the “Experimental systems” for music and adopted it as a basic research model for his research cluster MusicExperiment21.

When we perform a musical passage, we do not execute each and every note by itself. A musical fragment that contains 40 tones will not be performed through 40 isolated actions. The efficiency of piano performance at a very basic level groups notes into hand positions, thereby reducing the number of actions needed for the performance of the series of tones. Therefore, the multiple tones that were grouped under a hand position are executed through one physical gesture, one action.`,

When the performer manages to perceive a grouping structure in which each cognitive group accommodates a transition of hand position, the difficulty in execution is significantly reduced. This led to the formulation of the ‘preferred grouping structure-hand position relationship (see 'Motorically Imposed Perceptual Groupings', chapter 7 of this dissertation).",
          `The hand position, like other physical components of piano mechanisms (hand division, hand motion, fingerings, pedaling, etc.), influences the perceived grouping structure. As discussed in the “Cognitive Groupings in Gestalt Psychology” chapter, there are numerous criteria that interact in determining the perceived grouping structure. All these criteria have to do with the spatial configuration of stimulatory elements. The recognition that physical mechanisms influence perceived grouping structure led me to the formulation of the ‘motorically-imposed perceptual groupings’ which extend the existing Gestalt principles to account for the performer’s perspective. It changed the view on the procedure of music cognition from being understood as a purely mental procedure, to one that involves the human body and its actions, and it reinforced existing ecological views on music cognition that conceive of perception as the result of an interaction between a human perceiver and a sonic environment. `,

The emerging groups are the first fundamental step the human mind takes in ‘making sense’ of the stimuli it receives from the environment.

To address this, the chapter will explore the ”motorically imposed perceptual grouping principles”, which take into account the performer's physical movements and actions as they relate to and determine the perception of sound. A list of these motorically imposed grouping principles will be presented, along with a discussion of the conflicts that can arise between artistic intentions and motorically imposed perceptions as cognitive dissonances. Finally, I will present several examples of performative ways to grapple with cognitive dissonances.",

          "In the initial forming process of the “Performative-deep-structural analysis”; a musical practicing methodology that accommodates artistic exploration as part of the performance preparation; I decided to include the existing grouping principles as an informing terrain due to their relevance to phrasing (see chapter 2: “The Art of Phrasing”). The PDSA begins by exposing the structural affordances embedded in a musical score. Providing the ambiguity of the score, this includes examining which grouping structures can potentially emerge in performance. As I was working on a fragment of J.S. Bach’s Toccata from the 6th Partita, I noticed that despite having several theoretically plausible groupings embedded in the score, one particular grouping structure seemed to persistently prevail in my experience. This grouping structure, although compatible with the classical Gestalt principles, would not necessarily be the most theoretically probable one. Curiously, I noticed that this “improbable” grouping structure coincided perfectly with the division of the tones between my hands. This seemed to me to be more than a coincidence, and I immediately hypothesized that my experienced grouping structure, at least in this instance, is determined by the way I use my body in generating the sounds, rather than by the spatial configurations of the sounds, as the Gestalt psychology suggests. An initial test for this hypothesis is a very straightforward one: I played the musical fragment with a different hand division, and my hypothesis was confirmed: my grouping perception followed my hand division. In fact, my experienced grouping perception coincided entirely with any hand division I applied. Furthermore, I realized that intentionally perceiving a grouping structure that does not coincide with the hand position I use required a lot of mental effort. This made it reasonable for me to assume that my auditory perception is determined by the manner in which I use my body in generating the sounds I perceive. Moreover, I recognized that the Gestalt grouping principles, as well as Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s extension of it, are limited to only consider the listener’s perspective in grouping perception and that the structures perceived by a human that generates the sounds (i.e., a musical performer) might be based on entirely different criteria. It was then clear to me that for Informed Phrasing, the classical Gestalt principles, although still relevant, are simply not enough, and that two uncharted territories need to be explored: ",

          "The classical perceptual grouping principles mentioned above are founded upon the assertion that human perception is an exclusively mental function. In the writings on Gestalt, there is no reference to the human body and how physical movements can influence one’s perceptual organization. Nevertheless, recent studies in the field of embodied music cognition point to a dynamic system in which music perception is shaped through bodily engagements with music. For instance, in The Expressive Movement, Marc Leman argues that upon listening to music, the human mind associates sound patterns with intentional properties through the alignment of the body to the sound patterns. Thus, a 'goal-oriented physical action' is aligned to a musical pattern to which the mind assigns the action's goal. This idea is called 'embodiment': the process of transforming sound patterns into patterns with intentional properties; goal-oriented patterns, that are mediated through the human body and its actions repertoire. Despite the similarities in the action repertoires that we share as humans, each individual has their own personal collection of actions established upon their personal experiences. Considering the pivotal role of actions repertoire in embodied music cognition, these differences suggest that audio stimuli may be perceived differently among different individuals, as each may have different actions mediating the intentional properties of the same audio stimuli. Interestingly, Leman stresses that embodiment occurs also in instances in which the free movement of the body is inhibited, such as in western classical music concert settings.",

          "Embodied music cognition, thus, relies on the observation that humans have the ability to align body movements to music, and claims its vitality for their musical sense-making processes. The alignment of body movements with music allows researchers to study human perception through objective measurements of body movements, which strengthens their assertions empirically. Nevertheless, the manner in which different people align their body movements to music can also depend on the mode of their interaction with the music; meaning, whether they listen, perform, or compose; the actions repertoire that they possess; and their learned associations between sound-producing actions and the sonic results of these actions. For example, through years of intense practice and repetition, musical performers learn to associate sound-producing actions with their sonic outcomes. Maes & Leman have shown that this learned association is so strong that for performers that the mere sight of a sound-producing action will suffice for the activation of the brain area responsible for the auditory reception of its outcome. On the other hand, listeners who do not have any training in musical performance do not necessarily associate musical sounds with their originating action. Rather, for listeners, musical sounds are associated with gestural aspects of the sound configurations; with 'expressive gesturing'. In fact, Leman argues that musical patterns are made to correspond to expressive gesturing so that listeners will be able to make sense of the patterns by aligning these to the intended outcomes of the gestures.

          "For Informed Phrasing, the crucial point here is the perceptual divergence between a listener and a professional musical performer; each processes musical patterns according to their own physical engagement with music and to learned actions - sonic outcomes associations. While musical performers align sound-producing actions with musical patterns, listeners align expressive gesturing with sound configurations of musical patterns. Going back to Gestalt psychology, the latter perfectly complies with Gestalt grouping principles, as they deal exclusively with sound configurations and properties (the proximity and similarity of sounds). Whereas for musical performers, I suggest, the current classical grouping principles appeal much less, as their perception is influenced more significantly by their repertoire of sound-producing actions, rather than the expressive gesturing associated with spatial configurations of the sounds they perform.

The purpose of this chapter, then, is to propose criteria for grouping organizations in human-music interaction that occurs in musical performance. That is, to attend to what the research on Gestalt psychology has so far overlooked: the perceptual grouping organization of musical performers, and how their use of their body in producing sounds influences their perceptual organization of these sounds.

The perspective of the performer is a complex one as it functions both as the generator and the receiver of auditory stimuli. The performer generates sounds, the process of which entails performing sound-producing actions that, as argued above, influence the performer’s perception of the sounds. Nonetheless, performers also hear the sounds that they generate, which to a certain extent, put them in the perspective of the listeners, which, as argued above, is influenced by the spatial configurations of the received sounds. I often play around these two perspectives as I perform: in some performances I immerse myself into the performance as a physical activity, almost like dancing; and in other performances, I try to detach myself from my body and put myself entirely in the perspective of the listener as an attempt to grasp how my audience might experience my performance.

The notion of intention in human perception implies a certain degree of agency and subjectivity to the perceiver. When there are multiple theoretically plausible perceptual structures, in many cases the perceiver would have the ability to consciously choose what to perceive. For example, the hexagonal dot lattice below contains ‘tristable’ groupings, meaning three equally stable groupings: horizontal, diagonal left-to-right, and diagonal right-to-left. Upon looking, none of these groupings are exclusively imposed on perceivers, but they can alternate between the groupings as they wish. ",

These situations should be considered as opportunities for the performer to experiment and explore the various grouping structures afforded in a given musical situation and their artistic-musical consequences. Then, once a grouping interpretation has been established, the performer would might wish to realize this interpretation in their performance. But an interesting challenge occurs when such artistically established grouping interpretation contradicts a motorically imposed grouping perception. This situation, I propose, can be understood as cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is a state of discomfort generated by a discrepancy between conflicting cognitions. This state motivates the experiencing person to strive for a resolution, typically by adjusting one cognition to the other. Such cognitive dissonances are challenges that performers must confront in order to successfully convey their artistic intentions. Furthermore, the process of dealing with such cognitive dissonances is an integral part of the practice of musical performance. The ability to easily resolve and overcome cognitive dissonances in musical performance can even be considered as part of the performer’s mental virtuosity.",

I argue that the degree to which realizing artistic intentions in performance is difficult, relies, among other things, on the arousal of cognitive dissonance between artistically intended and motorically imposed perceptions. When such cognitive dissonance is aroused, a process of ‘negotiation’ will emerge in which the performer would experiment with possible mediations in an effort of resolving the dissonance. Ideally, this could be achieved by aligning the physical mechanisms of performance to conform with artistic intentions. In other cases, the performer might even consider modifying the artistic intentions to conform to motoric constraints.

However, avoiding the perception of the septuplets structure, and even more strongly, the subdivision of the septuplets into 2+5 was of utter difficulty, due to the significant effect of the ‘hand division’ principle. A negotiation process has therefore commenced which contained two main strategies: ",

          "This strategy included finding the motoric mechanisms that are aligned with the artistically intended structure. Ideally, I could adjust the division of the tones between my hands according to the artistically intended structure. Yet, this would have been both controversial and technically awkward. A better way would be to align a different aspect of the physical mechanism to the artistic intention, such as the hand movement. I could try to ‘bury’ the hand transition within an overarching hand gesture that begins from the left hand, continues into the right, and declines back into the left hand. Shifting the mental focus toward this gesture was also very helpful. ",

          "Another strategy I adopted was practicing the fragment with a hand division that is modified to align with the artistically intended structure. When played as such, the intended structure is easily perceptible as it is supported by both intention and principles of motorically imposed groupings. The aim was to repeat this exercise until an association between the sequence of tones and the emerging grouping structure is established, and this structure will be retained upon switching back to the original, contradicting hand divisions. Finally, I found that the combination of these two strategies worked for me and that I manage to perceive the fragment upon performance in the way that I wished. ",

          "In my contention, recognizing cognitive dissonances, coming up with strategies to resolve them, executing the strategies, and reassessing and adjusting strategies, is an integral part of a conscious, problem-solving-oriented practice of musical performance. I additionally strongly believe that when addressed properly, cognitive challenges in musical performance get gradually easier to resolve. When one successfully confronts a challenging technical passage in a given musical composition, it would generally help them in confronting other challenges that include a similar technique. The same would naturally apply to cognitive challenges of musical performance. This way, performers can develop themselves not only a technical, but mental virtuosi.",
