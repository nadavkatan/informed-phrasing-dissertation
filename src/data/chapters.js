While the pedagogy of normative musical performance was well-established, I observed a shortage of methodologies specifically designed to cultivate creative and performative engagement of pianists with pre-written tonal music compositions.`,

        content: `The last word of the title, <i>phrasing</i>, is no more than a practical delineation of scope. It means that the subject under investigation, whatever it is, is applied to <i>phrasing</i> as a specific and central component of musical performance. The ambiguity of the title, however, is due to the absence of its first word, the adverb that we would normally expect to precede the adjective <i>informed</i>. This grammatical component would have elucidated the specific agent involved in the process of informing one's use of phrasing. Considering my decision to incorporate Schenkerian and cognitive grouping analyses into the project, a perhaps more coherent title would have been <i>“Analytically Informed Phrasing”</i> or <i>“Schenkerian Phrasing”</i>. But this would have been wrong, as what I have come to realize regarding music analysis is that it sheds a stronger light on the person conducting the analysis rather than on the composition under inspection. Accordingly, both my attention and intention in using analytical methods shifted from observing compositional processes embedded in scores towards the creative processes essential to musical performance. The particular “informing agents” involved in this project, i.e., Schenkerian analysis and cognitive psychology, were not applied in order to justify interpretative choices or prescribe performances grounded in objectivity, but rather to stimulate critical-artistic reflection; to cultivate a genuine interaction between musician and music; to generate questions and grapple with them; and to facilitate creativity and reinforce individuality. This is simply what any practice of informed performance should promote, regardless of the agents involved. In this light, I would venture to propose that the most fitting title would have been <i>“Performatively Informed Phrasing”</i>.`,

In the conventional approach to piano education, the emphasis often centers on technical virtuosity: training the body to execute any musical desire of the mind. Simultaneously, it involves integrating the student into a longstanding performance tradition and developing a deep acquaintance with nuanced norms of musical performance.

Finally, the professor, using a plethora of methodologies, guides  the student towards incorporating their own educated interpretation into the student’s performance.

Their authority cannot be questioned, and performers must learn to accept that authority. Second, the music created by these composers exists in the form of “works” – put down into musical scores. Third, each work has inherent characteristics that form its <i>true</i> identity, which must resonate in any performance. The identity of the composition – its <i>truth</i> – is concealed within the musical score, and performance students must trust their teachers for knowing this truth. By faithfully and meticulously following the teacher's instructions, the performance students will have the chance to sonically reproduce the work as <i>truly</i> intended by the composer. In doing so, the performers fulfill their role in society, that is, as Leech Wilkinson puts it: to do <i>“history in sound”</i>.`,

It is the same comfort that religious orthodox practitioners possess – the comfort of <i>Teshuva</i>. Operating within clear boundaries and certainties is more manageable than <i>searching for one's own truth</i>. Being creative is simply more difficult.

Indeed, as it naturally is, the more often a certain word is spoken, the less people ponder about its meaning. One meaning of phrasing could pertain to the compositional practice, where it would simply refer to how composers divide the musical continuum into phrases. However, until the 19th-century, composers avoided delineating musical phrases on the their scores</i><span class="footnote">2</span>, an avoidance that was perceived by 19th-century editors as a lack of proper methodology, leading to performances that <i>“fall very far short in representing the true meaning of music”</i></i><span class="footnote">3</span>. The editors, in their claim to be able to understand the true meaning of music in spite of the composers' incompetence in regards to phrase markings, allowed themselves to use the <i>legato</i> slur in order to elucidate phrase boundaries on the score, thereby introducing the controversial “phrasing-slur”. There are several problems with the “phrasing-slur”. For one, it obscures the notion of what a “phrase” is, which leads to definitions such as: <i>“a group of notes that lies under a slur”</i></i><span class="footnote">4</span>. Furthermore, it implies that <i>phrasing</i> means the articulation of these phrases, leading to the most acute misunderstanding around <i>phrasing</i>: the notion of <i>phrasing</i> simply as playing <i>legato</i>. In my view, <i>phrasing</i> entails two fundamental, somewhat intertwined components: <i>grouping</i> and <i>shaping</i>.`,

A group of tones (e.g., a musical phrase) is a perception that emerges when the relationship between the tones complies with a number of conditions recognized and formulated by what is commonly known as Gestalt psychology. These conditions pertain to the spatial and temporal configurations of the tones as well as their properties. For instance, when the tones are relatively close to each other in pitch and time, and are similar to each other in timbre, the human mind tends to associate them with the same phrase/group.`,

        content: `In the performance of existing, written music (which is the focus of this project), when a phrase is being performed, the sonic relationship between the tones of the phrase, and thereby the cognitive formation of the phrase as a group, results from the collaboration between the composer and the performer. The musical score, provided by the composer, offers a number of groupings that may potentially emerge upon performance. From these grouping-affordances, the performer chooses the most artistically appropriate grouping structure to be communicated in performance. The performer, who is not necessarily or always aware of this process, would reinforce the Gestalt conditions that will allow his/her desired grouping structure to be perceived by the listener. Now, the performer might indeed use <i>legato</i> articulation in order to reinforce his/her grouping interpretation, yet there are other possibilities as well. Grouping tones into phrases can be achieved by using dynamics, timings, timbres, pedals, articulations, and any combination of these. It is up to the performer to first reveal the various grouping-affordances embedded in the score, to experiment and understand their individual expressive implications. Based on this understanding, the performer can select the most artistically compelling grouping and find the appropriate means to realize it in performance.`,

In my years as a piano student, I have found using a physical representation to convey an intended musical gesture to be extremely successful. The practice of orchestra/choir conducting is strong evidence for that, and the field of embodied music cognition provides interesting arguments for that success, which is discussed in Chapter 6 of this dissertation, titled “The Motorically Imposed Perceptual Groupings”. The <i>shaping</i> component of phrasing can thus be understood as the musical parallel of an expressive physical gesture. It pertains to the performer's continuous manipulation of time, volume, articulation, and timbre with the aim of presenting music with a sense of motion. A musical gesture is thus the complete trajectory of a musical unit created in performance. `,

        content: `The most common schema used by (especially modern) performers for forming musical gestures is called the “phrase arch”. Performers continuously vary tempo and loudness across phrases so as to delineate their beginnings and endings. For example, a phrase's beginning, articulated through a combination of accelerando and crescendo will build up toward a point of culminating tension that will be resolved by a complementing ritardando and diminuendo, marking the phrase's end<span class="footnote">5</span>. This entire process makes the individual tones of the phrase cohere into a single Gestalt: an expressive musical gesture. This “phrase arch” schema can be manifested in many different ways following the performer's individual interpretation. Nevertheless, it has a rather direct relationship to the structure of musical pieces. It is a performative means of projecting one's analytical interpretation of the formal structure of a musical piece. It follows the notion that expressive performance is one that projects the structure of the piece; that being expressive means expressing the structure. It has indeed been observed that the degree to which phrase beginnings and endings are articulated in performances is often a function of the structural importance of a phrase<span class="footnote">6</span>. This direct association of an expressive means of musical performance (e.g., shaping) with analysis of the music is a stylistic feature of modern performances<span class="footnote">7</span>. Musical masterpieces are elevated to the degree of a canonical Bible (and composers to gods, see figure 1), and understanding and complying with composers' intentions, as well as with what we imagine today as “stylistically authentic”, is what performers accept to be their duty. Analysis, then, is a tool to be used by performers in order to internalize the composer's intentions, and the “phrase-arch” is, in turn, used to sonically realize these intentions in performance. The aim of <i>Informed Phrasing</i> is to stimulate a process in which performance can respond to analysis (and vice versa!) in a much less direct and artificial way. `,

In tonal music, a <i>phrase</i> is a specific array of syntactic structures to which <i>phrasing</i> could apply in performance. However, <i>phrasing</i> applies not only to phrases but also to smaller units, or even segments of other functions (e.g., sequences, modulatory transitions, etc.). The appoggiatura, for example, is a unit that is significantly smaller than the phrase, to which phrasing can and should apply. The grouping level of the phrase simply represents the highest grouping level to which phrasing can apply.`,

Several levels exist simultaneously in linguistics: syllables group into words – which group into phrases – which group into sentences – which group into paragraphs etc.  The same grouping hierarchy exists in tonal music as well: individual sounds are grouped into motives – which are grouped into phrases – which are grouped into sections – which are grouped into movements etc. The difference here, which seems to me to contribute to the ambiguity around phrasing, is that while in linguistics, on the level of phrases, there are only phrases, in music, the grouping level of phrases can and normally does contain other syntactic structures than the musical phrase. Thus, while “phrasing” in linguistics necessarily applies to phrases, <i>musical phrasing</i> applies to the generation and manipulation of musical gestures whose highest magnitude is the musical phrase.`,

Instead of focusing on testing, experiments should be concentrated on what scientists actually <i>do</i>: the concrete and manual manipulation of objects, and the unexpected results that emerge in the process.

In Gestalt psychology, it occurs in both visual and auditory perception as the complexity and multiplicity of stimuli are reduced to a perception of a <strong>single independently perceived entity</strong>. It allows us to move naturally from hearing a flux of tones to a perception of a single phrase. The same kind of reduction is a fundamental necessity in the technique of piano performance, in the form of hand positions. When we perform a musical passage, we do not execute each and every note by itself. A musical fragment that contains 40 tones will not be performed through 40 isolated actions. The efficiency of piano performance at a very basic level groups notes into hand positions, thereby reducing the number of actions needed for the performance of the series of tones. As a result, the multiple tones that are grouped under a hand position are executed through one physical gesture, one action.`,

        items: [
          `In many cases, the compatibility between the two structures has a direct correlation with the difficulty of pianistic execution: many musical passages are more difficult to perform in instances where the two structures coincide. This is primarily due to the inherent difficulty of transitioning between hand positions during performance. Transitions of hand positions often make a musical passage difficult to perform. When the cognitive grouping structure coincide with the hand position structure, the execution becomes notably more challenging than when they conflict. In cases of conflict, the cognitive group accommodates the transition of hand position, facilitating a smoother transition, enhancing the fluency in performance. `,
          `In situations where the two structures align, the performer can try to modify their perceived grouping structure. Depending on the specific modification made, this adjustment can impact the level of difficulty in execution. When the performer manages to perceive a grouping structure in which each cognitive group accommodates a transition of hand position (i.e., “out of phase relationship”, see Chapter 6, “The Motorically Imposed Perceptual Groupings”), the difficulty in execution is significantly reduced. `,
          `The hand position, like other physical components of piano mechanisms (hand division, hand motion, fingerings, pedaling, etc.), influences the perceived grouping structure. As discussed in the chapter entitled “Cognitive Groupings in Gestalt Psychology”, there are numerous criteria that interact in determining the perceived grouping structure. All these criteria have to do with the spatial configuration of stimulatory elements. The recognition that physical mechanisms influence perceived grouping structure led me to the formulation of the “motorically imposed perceptual groupings”, which extend the existing Gestalt principles to account for the performer's perspective. It changed my perspective on the procedure of music cognition from one that I understood as a purely mental procedure to one that involves the human body and its actions, and it reinforced existing ecological views on music cognition that conceive of perception as the result of an interaction between a human perceiver and a sonic environment<span class="footnote">8</span>. `,

Against this, artistic researchers claim that musicological research fails to provide insights that have significant practical value for musical performers (hence the analysis-performance controversy, see Chapter 3 of this dissertation), as some knowledge can only be accessed <i>through</i> performance, rather than by an external observation <i>of</i> performance.

It is possible to misconstrue the idea by suggesting that for the fundamental line, and consequently for coherence, to be perceived, it must be actively heard. However, Gestalt psychologists have elucidated the divergence between received stimuli and the resulting perception: what we hear may not exactly correspond to what we perceive. More intriguingly, our perception is not always bound by the audible stimuli; we can perceive things that are not necessarily present in the sounds we hear. The “Gestalt principle of closure” is a notable example in the field of visual cognition: when tempted to do so, the human mind perceives lines that do not exist in order to form closed figures<span class="footnote">14</span>. Therefore, perceiving coherence in music does not necessarily mean hearing coherence, as much as perceiving a triangle would not necessarily mean seeing three complete verticals. In other words, if the fundamental line is crucial for creating “a sense of coherence”, it does not necessarily mean that “allowing the fundamental line to be heard” is the most artistically appropriate manner to create “a sense of coherence” in each and every musical example, if it is even at all necessary.`,

In his view, analysis should be used as a mode of performance or as composing, rather than as a tool to unveil objective truths about music. An analytical interpretation would then <i>construct</i> rather than <i>construe</i> meaning out of the score: <i>“the analyst tends to create the very meanings he or she presumes to uncover”</i><span class="footnote">16</span>. Furthermore, Cook claims that Schenker essentially held the same view of music analysis, perceiving it as a mere suggestion to hear music in a certain way. Analysis should not reflect how people listen to music but offer a possible hearing. Nevertheless, the problem with Schenker, frequently, is his imperative tone, according to which there is only one correct and true way to hear music: the one supposedly intended by the composer. In response to this, Cook proposes: <i>“we need a rationale for adopting Schenker's analytical methods while rejecting his epistemology”</i><span class="footnote">17</span>. Cook rationalizes, then, that the musical score, on which analysis is conducted, is inherently incomplete and thus bears various structural affordances; it enables various potential hearings of the score. Viewed as such, analysis is a performative act: it is a process of exposing and grappling with ambiguities and bringing forth a way in which a certain musical composition might be heard. With this perception in mind, performers can be granted the same degree of performativity as analysts.`,

          `<strong>Exposing ambiguities to be grappled with in performance</strong> <br/> Swinkin claims that ambiguity is an essential artistic quality as it precludes facile engagement with the artwork. Idiosyncratic interpretation thrives on ambiguity because it solicits our involvement and begs us to construct meaning. According to Swinkin, musical ambiguity is often manifested in structural uncertainty, and it is the performer's fundamental task to explore it and <i>project</i> a single way to hear the piece out of the multiple inherent expressive possibilities embedded in the score. `,
          `<strong>Metaphors for emotive and physical states</strong> <br/> Unambiguous analytical statements can be viewed as metaphors for physical and emotive states and thus become available to be sonically embodied in performance. Referring to Schenkerian analysis, Swinkin suggests that expressive potentialities emerge when one turns the attention to the relationships between surface and background structure. Thus, instead of focusing on the ways in which the background structure can be made audible in performance with the aim of “revealing the truth” about the composition, Swinkin suggests that the comprehension of the background structure illuminates the particularities of the foreground. This interaction between foreground and background, according to Swinkin, <i>“hold[s] salient physical implications”</i><span class="footnote">19</span> that can certainly be realized in performance. For example, a common Schenkerian phenomenon in which the background structure is manifested in the foreground is that of “motivic parallelism” (i.e., the Schenkerian <i>Motive</i>: a motive that originates in the background structure and finds expression in the middle-ground, foreground and the surface levels of the music). The particular way in which the motive is manifested in the foreground, for instance, stretched or compressed, can have expressive potentialities to be embodied in performance. It can be correlated with tension and urgency in the case of compression, and thus with slight acceleration; or breadth, in the case of a stretched motive, which might mean stretching the tempo. Another “structural metaphor” for emotive experience recognized by Swinkin involves linear motions from an inner voice as gradually emerging from beneath the surface. This could be manifested through a gradual crawling crescendo. The transition to the structural note, akin to emerging “into the light of day,” carries timbral implications for the performance.`,

Musical performance requires a thorough process of decision-making and indeed most performers are concerned with how music “works” and how to overcome conceptual challenges. This process, in many cases, involves an analytical investigation. Nevertheless, the kind of investigation employed by performers as they construct their interpretation is of a different nature than the musicological, formal music analysis that has so far been forced onto performance. The two sorts of analysis differ in various respects, such as the methodological rigor, the system, the completeness, the terminology applied, and the respective areas of interest. Rink labels the analysis that is most relevant for performers <i>“a performer's analysis”</i> and conceives it as the <i>“considered study of the score with particular attention to contextual functions and [the] means of projecting them”</i><span class="footnote">21</span>. This is not an independent procedure applied to the act of interpretation but an integral part of it.  As opposed to the “musicological analysis” which explores the <i>structure</i> of music, the performer's analysis, according to Rink, is primarily concerned with the <i>shape</i> of music, and is often guided by what Rink calls <i>Informed Intuition</i><span class="footnote">22</span>: performance intuition based upon considerable knowledge and experience.`,

The performer's analysis is a compilation of several analytical undertakings that Rink suggests: identifying formal structural divisions and basic tonal plan, graphing tempo, graphing dynamics, graphing melodic shape and contour, and preparing a rhythmic reduction. The insights generated by these analyses accumulate into “intensity curves”, i.e., <i>“a graphic representation of the music's ebb and flow, its “contour” in time”</i><span class="footnote">24</span>.  Going through Rink's demonstrations of how he exercises these analyses, I was struck by how accessible and relevant these are for performers. For example, an issue that I, like many pianists performing on a modern piano, often grapple with in the preparation of a musical performance is the large-scale dynamic shape of the composition. In which part of the composition should the climax take place? How and where should the music build up to it, and resolve thereafter? Are there multiple climaxes and how do they compare in significance? The dynamics graphing suggested by Rink is a good way to start solving these problems. Rink suggests the creation of a temporal graph that maps the dynamic marks in the score onto the relevant bars in which they occur (see Figure 2).`,

As I explored the ways I can interact with these components in my practice, I gradually realized that, as relevant for my practice as they can be, the criteria upon which my analytical interpretation is formed were too intellectually oriented to be incorporated into my performance. I found that in Schenkerian analysis, for instance, the top-down approach in the process of classifying tones as structural, which primarily relies on the potential compatibility with predefined contrapuntal formulas, contradicts how I <i>experience</i> the music. Furthermore, it often happened that groupings that should emerge in perception (based on Gestalt principles) were barely possible to be <i>experienced</i> in the act of performance. I concluded that for the purpose of enhancing my performance, analytical decisions should be taken based on performative experiences rather than on predefined concepts. Accordingly, for the analysis to represent performative experience, the act of performance must be a part of the analytical procedure. In the context of my personal practice, <i>Analysis</i> should not be a segregated mental exercise applied to (and thus constraining) performance, but rather an ongoing interaction between an ambiguous score and the performer's embodied cognition, leading to a fluid perception of the music that allows for spontaneity, reinforces coherence, and, most importantly, forms a deep connection between the performer and their performance.`,

        content: `Heinrich Schenker (1868-1935) was an Austrian music theorist, teacher, and pianist. He is considered one of the most important figures in the field of music theory of the 20th century. Schenker developed a unique approach to music analysis, known as Schenkerian analysis, which emphasizes the underlying, generative structural relationships within a piece of music. He believed that the most important aspect of music was the tonal structure and that this structure could be revealed through analysis of the relationships between individual notes and chords.`,

        type: "text",
        content: `Schenker's approach to analysis was based on his belief that a piece of music is not simply a collection of isolated notes, but rather a hierarchical structure of melodies, harmonies, and counterpoints. He argued that by understanding the underlying structure of a piece, one could gain a deeper understanding of its meaning and aesthetic value. Schenker's ideas have had a significant impact on the field of music theory, and his approach to analysis is still widely used and taught today. Despite its German roots, the Schenkerian thought has found significantly more resonance in the scholarly discourse and music education in North America than in Europe. This is due to the fact that most of Schenker's disciples were jews who fled Europe to North America during the 1930s and effectively pioneered the Schenkerian tradition in the US.`,

Tonality, in my contention, is not a binary property of a composition, but rather a spectrum. The more tonal a composition is, the more suitable for Schenkerian analysis. For the <i>Ursatz</i>, the most fundamental component of Schenkerian analysis, is closely tied to Schenker's particular perception of tonality. Schenker viewed tonality as the life of a single tone as it governs the entire musical work. He explains how in nature, a single tone is built out of a fundamental and its various upper partials and harmonics. The first four harmonics produced out of the fundamental tone are the octave, the fifth, the following octave, and the major third. These harmonics form the major triad which Schenker called the <i>Klang</i><span class="footnote">2</span> (translated as “Sound” or “Ring”).`,

The C2 is prolonged using several techniques: in bar 1 and 2, surface-level consonant skips and repetitions, then in bar 3, C2 changes its function and becomes a dissonant, passing note, between the locally prolonged Db2 and its consonant skip Bb. The Db2 functions as a high-level neighbor note of the C2 of the first two bars, which ultimately resolves back to C2 in the fourth bar. The reduction of this fragment presents my interpretation of the deep structure: the first two bars contain nothing but a prolonged C2, bar 3 accommodates Db2 as a neighbor note (which in Schenkerian graphing is marked as an eighth note), which is prolonged through the passing motion and resolves in bar 4.`,

This initial ascent is elaborated through another prolongation technique called “voice exchange” in which the upper and lower voices exchange their tones: the very first C2 is being picked up by the bass in the 2nd beat of the same bar, and vice versa: the very first Ab of the bass is being picked up by the upper voice in the 2nd beat. The initial ascent in the upper voice is supported by a parallel progression in the bass, forming a linear intervallic pattern of parallel 10ths. A linear intervallic pattern is a contrapuntal pattern embedded in the surface. Parallel 10ths are a particularly common pattern, yet others include patterns of 5–6, 8–10, 5–8, 7–10, and many more.`,

I wrote a thesis entitled “Phrasing the Schenkerian Levels” that focused on the potential use of  Schenkerian analysis in the performative act of phrasing. Within this context, I had the unique opportunity to interview Murray Perahia, a renowned Schenkerian performer. During our conversation, I inquired about Perahia's vision regarding the relationship between Schenkerian analysis and musical expression in performance. Perahia claimed that expression stems from musical movement, and it is essential to uncover the construction and development of tonal motion in order to produce expressive performances. Perahia further observed that many student performers mistakenly attempt to be expressive with every single note, which ironically generates the opposite effect. Instead, performers should identify crucial expressive moments, represented by structural notes, and shape the musical motion in accordance with these notes. Phrasing gestures are thus created by using surface notes to direct motion towards structural notes as “phrasing goals”.`,

The Shannon-Wiener communication model, for example, is primarily concerned with the transmission of semantic, meaningful messages between a sender and a receiver.  According to this model, successful communication occurs when the message conveyed by a sender (e.g., a musical performer) is interpreted by the receiver (e.g., a listener) in the way the sender intended it to be. This process begins with the sender being in an “intentional state”, encoding an intended message into a (musical) sound pattern.

Decoding a musical pattern into a semantic meaning requires reflective conceptualization, which, in turn, requires an external perspective on the experience.

The three selected terrains (or as de Assis calls them, things) – Schenkerian analysis, Gestalt psychology, and musical performance – enter the <i>“field of problematicity”</i>, where they are rearranged and enter into an interaction as part of the creative process of artistic research. This interaction between the <i>things</i> reveals the weaknesses of each <i>thing</i> separately but also stimulates their rearrangement, and perhaps evolution, in order to overcome such shortcomings. For example, as I applied the Gestalt grouping principles to my piano performance, the gap between theory and experience, as well as the false distinction between body and mind, became very clear. This stimulated reflections, readings, discussions, and experiments, which ultimately resulted in a set of principles that address these shortcomings and are presented in Chapter 6.`,

          `The Schenkerian analysis is typically conducted outside of a performance setting, which can make its application to actual performances awkward. This awkwardness, just as in Gestalt psychology, results from the gap between analytical statements that are generated purely based on compliance with a theory and actual performance experiences. A potential solution would be to conduct the analysis at the instrument, as part of the instrumental practice – as if to “consult” and thus involve performative experience in the analytical process. For me, this meant that the final analytical result does not need to be represented graphically but sonically. This, however, necessitates the redesigning of the analytical process as well as the criteria on whose basis analytical judgments are made. `,
          `In Schenkerian analysis, analytical decisions are made based upon the potential compliance with predefined analytical dogmas. The techniques of contrapuntal prolongation described above can be applied to generate various analytical statements. Yet the prevailing statement would necessarily be the one which manifests best the <i>Ursatz</i> and the <i>Motive</i><span class="footnote">12</span>. The compliance with these concepts is ultimately what makes an interpretation “Schenkerian”. In my experience, this very often results in theoretically proper yet counterintuitive interpretations that do not reflect musical experience. The solution that I offer to this problem, which I have incorporated into my research, is to differentiate between <i>tools</i> and <i>theory</i>. <i>Tools</i> refer to the contrapuntal prolongation techniques, while <i>theory</i> stands for the Schenkerian predefined dogmas. The <i>tools</i> should be used to generate deep structural (non-Schenkerian) interpretations that are based on and reflect performative experience rather than the theoretical idea of an <i>Ursatz</i>. This means that once they are deeply acquainted with contrapuntal techniques, performers can apply them to a musical fragment at the instrument, revealing all structural possibilities and impossibilities, and choosing the one that corresponds most closely with their experience. The deep, predefined contrapuntal formulas – the dogmas – are interesting ideas to be acquainted with, but, for me, have no benefit when they are applied to the performance act of phrasing and its performative-analytical preparation.`,

The emerging groups are the first fundamental step the human mind takes in “making sense” of the stimuli it receives from the environment. Although the grouping principles were initially developed in order to explicate humans' <i>visual</i> perception, they apply in a similar way to <i>auditory</i> perception as well. The principles of <i>auditory</i> groupings (i.e., <i>grouping preference rules</i>), formulated by Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff in their book <i>A Generative Theory of Tonal Music</i>, even received empirical support from a study conducted by Irène Deliège<span class="footnote">1</span>.`,

To bridge this gap, the chapter lays out the “motorically imposed perceptual grouping principles,” which consider the performer's physical movements and actions in shaping the perception of sound. The chapter additionally presents a catalog of these motorically imposed grouping principles, accompanied by a discussion of the potential conflicts between artistic intentions and motorically imposed perceptions, resembling cognitive dissonances. Finally, several examples are provided to demonstrate performative approaches to navigating cognitive dissonances in musical performance.`,

        content: `In the initial forming process of the Performative Deep Structural Analysis (PDSA), a musical practicing methodology that accommodates artistic exploration as part of the performance preparation, I decided to include the existing grouping principles as an informing terrain due to their relevance to phrasing (see Chapter 1, “The Art of Phrasing”). The PDSA begins by exposing the structural affordances embedded in a musical score. Providing the ambiguity of the score, this includes examining which grouping structures can potentially emerge in performance. As I was working on a fragment of J.S. Bach's Toccata from the 6th Partita, I noticed that despite finding several theoretically plausible groupings embedded in the score, one particular grouping structure seemed to persistently prevail in my experience. This grouping structure, although compatible with the classical Gestalt principles, would not necessarily be the most theoretically probable one (see below, figure 11: “Artistically intended structure”, and figure 12: “The motorically imposed grouping”). Curiously, I noticed that this “improbable” grouping structure coincided perfectly with the division of the tones between my hands. This seemed to me to be more than a coincidence, and I immediately hypothesized that the grouping structure I experienced, at least in this instance, was determined by the way I use my body in generating the sounds, rather than by the spatial configurations of the sounds, as Gestalt psychology suggests. An initial test for this hypothesis was a very straightforward one. I played the musical fragment with a different hand division and my hypothesis was confirmed: my grouping perception followed my hand division. In fact, my experienced grouping perception coincided entirely with any hand division I applied. Furthermore, I realized that intentionally perceiving a grouping structure that does not coincide with the hand position I use requires a lot of mental effort. This made it reasonable for me to assume that my auditory perception is determined by the manner in which I use my body in generating the sounds I perceive. Moreover, I recognized that the Gestalt grouping principles, as well as Lerdahl and Jackendoff's extension of them, are limited in that they only consider the listener's perspective in the grouping perception, and that the structures perceived by a human who generates the sounds (i.e., a musical performer) might be based on entirely different criteria. It then became clear to me that to achieve what I call <i>Informed Phrasing</i> the classical Gestalt principles, although still relevant, are simply not enough, and that two uncharted territories needed to be explored:`,

In the writings on Gestalt, there is no reference to the human body and how physical movements can influence one's perceptual organization. Nevertheless, recent studies in the field of embodied music cognition point to a dynamic system in which music perception is shaped through bodily engagements with music. For instance, in <i>The Expressive Movement</i>, Marc Leman argues that while listening to music the human mind associates sound patterns with intentional properties through the alignment of the body with the sound patterns. Thus, a “goal-oriented physical action” is aligned with a musical pattern to which the mind assigns the action's goal. This idea is called “embodiment”: the process of transforming sound patterns into patterns with intentional properties – goal-oriented patterns – that are mediated through the human body and its repertoire of actions. Despite the similarities in the action repertoires that we share as humans, each individual has their own personal collection of actions established on the basis of their personal experiences. Considering the pivotal role of action repertoire in embodied music cognition, these differences suggest that audio stimuli may be perceived differently among different individuals, as each may have different actions mediating the intentional properties of the same audio stimuli. Interestingly, Leman stresses that embodiment occurs also in instances in which the free movement of the body is inhibited, such as in Western classical music concert settings. `,

The alignment of body movements with music allows researchers to study human perception through objective measurements of body movements, which strengthens their assertions empirically. Nevertheless, the manner in which different people align their body movements with music can also depend on the mode of their interaction with the music (whether they listen, perform, or compose), the actions repertoire that they possess, and their learned associations between sound-producing actions and the sonic results of these actions. For example, through years of intense practice and repetition, musical performers learn to associate sound-producing actions with their sonic outcomes. Leman & Maes have shown that this learned association is so strong that for performers the mere sight of a sound-producing action will suffice for the activation of the brain area responsible for the auditory reception of its outcome<span class="footnote">5</span>. On the other hand, listeners who do not have any training in musical performance do not necessarily associate musical sounds with their originating action. For listeners, musical sounds are associated, rather, with gestural aspects of the sound configurations – with “expressive gesturing”. In fact, Leman argues that musical patterns are made to correspond to expressive gesturing so that listeners will be able to make sense of the patterns by aligning these with the intended outcomes of the gestures. This is particularly the case with the gestures of a conductor in front of an orchestra: these gestures often elucidate the music’s structure, motions, and emotions to the public. `,

Going back to Gestalt psychology, the listener's experience perfectly complies with Gestalt grouping principles, as they deal exclusively with sound configurations and properties (the proximity and similarity of sounds). Whereas for musical performers, I would suggest, the traditional grouping principles appeal much less, as their perception is influenced more significantly by their repertoire of sound-producing actions, rather than by the expressive gesturing associated with the spatial configurations of the sounds they perform.`,

That is, I wish to attend to what the research on Gestalt psychology has so far overlooked: the perceptual grouping organization of musical performers, and how their use of their body in producing sounds influences their perceptual organization of these sounds. Ultimately, I intend to list a set of principles of “Motorically Imposed Perceptual Groupings” that explicate the grouping criteria involved in the perceptual sense-making process in musical performance.`,

Nonetheless, performers also hear the sounds that they generate, which to a certain extent put them in the perspective of the listeners, which, as argued above, is influenced by the spatial configurations of the received sounds. I often play around these two perspectives as I perform: in some performances, I immerse myself into the performance as a physical activity, almost like dancing; and in other performances, I try to detach myself from my body and put myself entirely in the perspective of the listener as an attempt to grasp how my audience might experience my performance.`,

Then, once a grouping interpretation has been established, the performer might wish to realize this interpretation in their performance. But an interesting challenge occurs when such an artistically established grouping interpretation contradicts a motorically imposed grouping perception. This situation, I propose, can be understood as <i>cognitive dissonance</i>. Cognitive dissonance is a state of discomfort generated by a discrepancy between conflicting cognitions. This state motivates the experiencing person to strive for a resolution, typically by adjusting one cognition to the other<span class="footnote">7</span>. Such cognitive dissonances are challenges that performers must confront in order to successfully convey their artistic intentions. Furthermore, the process of dealing with such cognitive dissonances is an integral part of the practice of musical performance. The ability to easily resolve and overcome cognitive dissonances in musical performance can even be considered as part of the performer's mental virtuosity<span class="footnote">8</span>.`,

When such cognitive dissonance is aroused, a process of “negotiation” will emerge in which the performer will experiment with possible mediations in an effort to resolve the dissonance. Ideally, this could be achieved by aligning the physical mechanisms of performance with artistic intentions. In other cases, the performer might even consider modifying artistic intentions to conform to motoric constraints. For instance, in my work on the Toccata from Bach's Partita no. 6, I established the following grouping structure as my artistic intention: `,

When a player successfully confronts a challenging technical passage in a given musical composition, it will generally help them in confronting other challenges that include a similar technique.

        content: `Thus, improvisation is the medium that allows performers to both internalize and spontaneously react to their analytical statements. While in most cases, though not all, improvisation is the final art form presented to the audience, in <i>Informed Phrasing</i> improvisation is a tool used primarily in generating artistic interpretations for written compositions. The term itself can have different meanings and is associated with different practices. However, in the case of <i>Informed Phrasing</i> “improvisation” pertains more closely to terms such as “counterpoint improvisation” and perhaps even “generative improvisation”. While the first two modes of interaction (analytical and pragmatic) result in a contrapuntal analysis which contains several levels of structural abstraction, improvisation is a device the performer uses in order to make their way back from the deep structure generative of the musical surface. Along this way, the performer “re-composes” the music, traversing through the different structural levels. It is in the sense of using improvisation as a tool to generate musical surfaces through the prolongation of deep contrapuntal and harmonic structures that I use the label “generative improvisation”. In this process, performance decisions, such as phrasing gestures, are made spontaneously, yet they are based on a rational analysis and grounded in individual musical experience. Each session leads to different phrasing interpretations, which may or may not manifest the underlying analysis. The performers can then evaluate the emerging phrasings and select those that they wish to incorporate into their final performance of the musical surface. This improvisational approach to generating artistic interpretations that emphasize the individual is primarily based on the work of David Dolan<span class="footnote">1</span> and resonates with Schenkerian theory and improvisational practices of the 18th century. During the research process of <i>Informed Phrasing</i>, I became aware of the various benefits of that creative interaction: the internalization of musical analysis, the balance achieved between rationality and immediacy, the creation and reinforcement of deep connections between performers and their interpretations, and the stimulation of a unique state of mind during improvisation – a state of mind that can be utilized not only during improvisation but in the performance of written compositions as well. `,

In the analysis, students seek long-term harmonic processes of “tension” and “relaxation”, which form “fundamental structures” and serve as a basis for creative improvisation. The goals of this process are to enhance performers' ability to apply structural and harmonic knowledge “in real time”, develop a deeper understanding of stylistic nuances, and enable the exploration of multiple interpretations of a musical piece. Through this process, the performers' creativity and freedom are reinforced, while maintaining a strong grasp of the underlying structure.`,

In this study, Dolan et al. compared two chamber music performances of the same pre-written musical composition, where each group of performers was instructed to apply either a “standard approach” (which includes the reproduction of agreed-upon performance actions and interpretations) or an “improvisatory approach” (which includes spontaneous decision-making and insertions of extemporized notes). This comparison allowed the researchers to pinpoint and characterize a distinct state of mind relating to the improvisatory performances. This state of mind, as their study established, was shared not only among the members of the ensemble, but to some extent with audience members as well. Additionally, it was found that improvisatory performances were more varied in performed timbres and dynamics, had longer-term phrasing gestures, and were perceived as more musically convincing and emotionally compelling by audience members. Most importantly, the data extracted and analyzed through <i>Sonic Visualizer</i>, as well as the performers' own accounts, revealed that, compared to the standard performance, the improvisatory performers were more immersed in the act of performance in a manner that aligns with the psychological state of <i>Flow</i>, as outlined by Csikszentmihalyi<span class="footnote">4</span>. As a performer for whom improvisation was not an integrated part of his daily practice, the findings of this study resonated with some of my experiences in my own research process. The fact that this state of mind is not limited merely to actual improvisations but can be utilized for the performance of written music as well made the choice to incorporate “generative improvisation” into the PDSA all the more compelling.`,

In this context, improvisation is seen as the spontaneous realization of a fundamental plan in the form of figured bass.

Compositions were a patchwork of learned, somewhat abstract contrapuntal schemas that performers were expected to gracefully realize and embellish through spontaneous improvisation. The training that performers received included the development of deep familiarity with these schemas, as well as the collection of numerous ways in which these schemas can be realized. This collection, which Gjerdingen, in his book <i>Music in the Galant Style</i>, insightfully associates with the <i>Zibaldone</i> of the actors of the <i>Commedia dell'arte</i>, would then serve as a stock of possible realizations with which performers could build their improvisations<span class="footnote">12</span>.`,

In studying 18th-century contrapuntal schemas and compositions, I noticed early on how much the skills that I had to employ in finding the underlying schemas were similar to those employed when conducting a Schenkerian analysis: both activities entail looking beyond surface complexity and identifying significant tendencies that align with predefined and familiar patterns. However, since the Galant schemas belong primarily to the structural foreground / shallow middle ground, they seem very tangible and generally conform with how music actually feels, whereas Schenker's formulas (i.e., the few variations of the <i>Ursatz</i>) stretch over much larger time spans and thus make it virtually impossible to experience their link to surface realizations. Even more fundamentally, as mentioned above, Galant compositions were conceived as the refined chain of well-knitted passages, a notion that Schenkerian theory, which views composition as a generative process, fiercely opposes.`,

They should ask themselves: "What could this music be?" rather than fixating on what the music is supposed to be objectively, ultimately striving to uncover as many analytical affordances and contradictions as possible.

In short, while the first two phases of the PDSA are intended to explore the structural depths of music, the stage of “creative interaction” employs generative improvisation as a means to resurface from the depths. This process primarily uses the Schenkerian tool of <i>Auskomponierung</i>, or “composing out”, in order to depart from deep contrapuntal progressions back towards the musical surface. `,

          `<strong>Forming a Grouping Structure</strong><br/><i>Analytical interaction – revealing structural affordances</i><br/>The first step of the PDSA is the formation of a hierarchical grouping structure. The process of creating a grouping structure begins with an exploration of the structural affordances of a musical phrase. In essence, this entails recognizing the potential groupings within the score by drawing upon various principles of cognitive grouping formations, such as the Gestalt principles and those related to motorically imposed perceptual groupings. The performer's task is to unveil the numerous organizational possibilities inherent in the musical score.<br/><br/><i>Pragmatic interaction – negotiating</i><br/>Subsequently, the performer “interacts” with the revealed grouping structures, as well as with their own embodied cognition in performance - through performance. This interaction aims to determine the most effective grouping structure in practice. The performer additionally attempts to enhance their perception of the selected grouping structure. This may entail adjusting the physical mechanisms involved in performance in order to align sound-producing actions with artistically intended structures.`,
          `<strong>Forming the Multileveled Contrapuntal Structure</strong><br/><i>Analytical interaction – revealing structural affordances</i><br/>Deriving a grouping structure from the score is inherently significant for the practice of phrasing, as discussed in Chapter 1, “The Art of Phrasing”. Nevertheless, the amalgamation of the two informing agents of <i>Informed Phrasing</i>, namely, <i>grouping</i> and <i>shaping</i>, takes form in a manner akin to Lerdahl and Jackendoff's <i>Generative Theory of Tonal Music</i>. In this context, the grouping structure serves as a foundational element for contrapuntal reduction. <br/><br/>Starting from lower-level grouping structures, the performer reduces the sounds within each group to include merely 1 to 2 notes. This process establishes the first lower-level contrapuntal reduction of the music. With this reduction, the performer proceeds to use the grouping structure at the next higher level to repeat the same process, creating the contrapuntal reduction at the corresponding hierarchical level. This sequence continues until the contrapuntal reduction attains a level of abstraction parallel to the phrase's <i>Ursatz</i>. The result is a hierarchical, multileveled contrapuntal reduction of the music.<br/><br/>During this process, it becomes clear that contrapuntal reduction is to a large extent dependent on grouping structure. Thus, different grouping interpretations will generate different analytical affordances for the contrapuntal reduction.<br/><br/>It is important to note that at each stage of the reduction it is common to encounter multiple structural affordances, such as various potential contrapuntal progressions. The performer is not required to ascertain a single “correct” analytical statement. Instead, as a preparatory step for the forthcoming interaction phase, they should aim to unveil as many structural affordances as possible. In this context, a solid grasp of Schenkerian tools of contrapuntal prolongation (see Chapter 4, “Schenkerian Analysis and Tonal Motion”) becomes crucial. <br/><br/><i>Pragmatic interaction – negotiating</i><br/>Once more, the performer engages with the analytical affordances through their performative experience. The performer actively experiments with the different reductions during practice, assessing them based on their resemblance of the musical surface, their presumed emotional content, and their artistic impact on performance. The formulation of the final reduction need not be a result of rationalization but should intuitively resonate during practice. At the end of this phase, the performer should have a well-formulated analytical representation of the phrase. `,
          `<strong>Creatively Responding Through Generative Improvisation</strong><br/><i>Creative interaction – a performative response to music analysis</i><br/>The “creative interaction” begins with an iterative performance of the deepest contrapuntal reduction established in the analysis. Once the performer feels sufficiently prepared, they start embellishing the notes of this foundational reduction. The embellishments are meant to be entirely spontaneous and should progressively evolve in complexity, thereby guiding us to the next structural level of the analysis. The tools of Schenkerian prolongation, such as neighbouring notes, passing notes, appoggiaturas, etc., can assist the performer in their embellishments of structural notes. The same procedure should then unfold within the next structural level, thus carving the way to the subsequent level, ultimately completing the circle by coming back to the musical surface.<br/><br/>In essence, these evolving improvisational embellishments serve as a means to “compose out” (<i>auskomponieren</i>) the abstract contrapuntal progressions present in the analysis, effectively bringing forth the musical surface from its contrapuntal depths. This process ensures the transformation of the analysis from a mental representation of the music into an experience seamlessly integrated into the act of performance. Furthermore, the final sonic outcome – the performance of the musical surface – does not arise from a deliberate decision-making process but rather as a spontaneous, performative response to the analysis. Finally, whether the analysis becomes audible or not is determined by the performance intuition of each individual performer.`,

Interestingly, although all the students majored in musical performance (classical piano), their approach to answering my questions was always intellectually rather than experientially oriented. They regularly turned to musical analysis or to the history of musical performance styles, seeking the “correct”, “true” answer instead of trusting their artistic expertise and intuition and exploring the grouping formations that they experience in performance, those that are true to them. Some students were even consistently reluctant to “consult” their performative experience in exploring groupings. This might have been a coincidence, but these were the more advanced students. Furthermore, it so happened that the students who were in the first years of their academic trajectory were much more open-minded and the process of asking questions, revealing ambiguities, interacting with these ambiguities, and resolving ambiguities was much more natural to apply.`,

This revealed an extremely repetitive and consistent performance gesture in the pre-PDSA performance. This gesture, I believe, is what leads to an impression of a “formal”, “objective” performance.  The use of time fluctuations is extremely regular. In every bar, Alex consistently shortens the 3rd beats and prolongs the 1st beats. The 3rd beats are consistently shorter than the average beat length, and the 1st is consistently longer than the 3rd. This tendency occurs throughout the performance with one exception: the 6th bar, in which he prolongs the 3rd beat. This 3rd beat happens to accommodate the highest note of the phrase, which is also marked with an accent in the score. Overall, Alex applies this gesture for accentuation throughout his performance, mostly in order to emphasize the meter, and exceptionally for emphasizing high notes. By contrast, the dynamics are not used to emphasize the first beat, at least not in a consistent manner. He does use dynamics, however, to accentuate the high note in bar 6. Otherwise there seems to be no systematic use of dynamics. While time fluctuations were used to project the metric structure, the dynamics project a grouping structure of 4 + 4 through softening phrase ends, thereby conforming with Todd's phrase-arch model.`,

As mentioned above, the post-PDSA performance presents a more extensive use of dynamic fluctuations as well as a larger dynamic span. These, together with the time fluctuations, happen to project more saliently the grouping structure both in its largest form (4+4) and in more nuanced formations.

Personally, interacting with Pieter served as a valuable exercise in guiding students with critical minds who don't merely accept information as facts but encourage deeper exploration and the presentation of compelling arguments. In Pieter's case, the primary challenge centered around his understanding of cognitive group subdivisions. He was deeply committed to expressing longer phrasing lines in the 1st theme of W. A. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 27. However, this commitment sometimes hindered his ability to recognize that longer musical phrases inherently consist of shorter, interconnected components. Understanding and acknowledging these shorter groups might be crucial for achieving an interpretation that could effectively support his desire for extended phrasing gestures. Furthermore, Pieter struggled with the systematic application of the PDSA. He exhibited a tendency to rush straight to the contrapuntal reduction, bypassing the essential step of forming a grouping structure. This inclination posed an additional layer of complexity in our collaborative work.`,

It is clear that while the pre-PDSA performance is rather static dynamically (which would contribute to smaller groupings being projected), the post-PDSA performance has a clear, Todd-style phrase-arch that encompasses the entire phrase, marking it as the most prominent structural group. This coincides beautifully with Pedro's experience with the PDSA method. For him, the method should be used to engrave his artistic conception of the phrase into his performative experience, enabling him to easily communicate his intentions with his audience – an extremely important and challenging aspect of musical performance.`,

During the practical phase, it became clear that this influence is manifested uniquely not only depending on performers but also within different performances by the same student. This observation underscores a crucial facet of the PDSA method: that it does not prescribe a standardized template for performances. Instead, it serves as a tool capable of eliciting distinctive and personalized interpretations for each performer. This inherent flexibility suggests that the methodology has the potential to bring forth something truly unique for every individual who engages with it, thereby enriching the landscape of musical interpretation and performance.`,

          `All the participating students performed on a modern piano, which is not the instrument for which their case study composition was originally written. Furthermore, my own experiments were conducted on a modern piano as well, notwithstanding that most of the pieces were not originally composed for this instrument. After conducting the experiments on PDSA and analyzing the results, one could anticipate that a PDSA session on different instruments of the same family (e.g., modern piano vs. harpsichord) would yield distinct outcomes, i.e., different influences. This expectation follows the understanding that the physical, sonic, and thus artistic interaction of the performer with the generated sounds is inherently conditioned by the characteristics of the instrument. This underscores the essential role of the <i>pragmatic interaction</i> phase in the PDSA process.`,
          `All the experiments focused exclusively on tonal music. From its inception, the <i>Informed Phrasing</i> project was conceived with a specific emphasis on phrasing in tonal music, primarily due to its relevance to my own practice. This naturally prompts the question of the relevance of PDSA to post-tonal music. <br/>Given the broadness of the realm of post-tonal music, claiming PDSA as a universally suitable tool is virtually impossible. Nevertheless, as long as a composition comprises definite pitches, each key component of the PDSA can have its relevance. Hierarchical counterpoint, although often associated with tonal music, is not exclusive to it and can indeed be applied in post-tonal compositions, too. Furthermore, cognitive groupings are formed even in music of indefinite pitches. The intriguing question persists regarding the potential transformations and adaptations that PDSA would need to undergo to more directly address the artistic interests of the performance practice of post-tonal music.`,
